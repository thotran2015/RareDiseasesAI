According to Arendt grading of stress fractures, time required to return to sports is approximately 3 weeks for Grade 1 injury, 3–6 weeks for Grade 2 injury, 12–16 weeks for Grade 3 injury with Grade 4 injury requiring more than 16 weeks of rest15 (Table 2).\\n\\nTable 1.

Furthermore, the area between SIF and the articular surface usually demonstrates high signal intensity on T2 weighted images owing to marrow oedema, especially in the early phase of the fracture.25 Prognostically, some SIF can resolve after conservative treatment while others progress to subarticular collapse and subsequent osteoarthritis requiring surgical intervention.22–24 According to literature, the length of SIF has prognostic value, being shorter in patients without progression to collapse (mean 13.4\\u2009mm) than in patients with progression to collapse (22.5\\u2009mm).26 The percentage of weight-bearing femoral head involved is also described as a prognostic factor for predicting the progression to collapse.26\\n\\nFigure 4.

They are strongly linked to long-term therapy for osteoporosis with bisphosphonates33 or other antiresorptive medication such as RANKL inhibitors.34 Other medications such as long-term glucocorticoid therapy, proton pump inhibitors are also implicated. Some of the other bone diseases such as hypophosphatasia, pyknodysostosis and osteopetrosis, vitamin D deficiency, and rheumatoid arthritis35 have also been associated with the occurrence of AFF.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Pathophysiology of the AFF is still poorly understood. Bisphosphonates used in the treatment of osteoporosis act by inhibiting the osteoclasts, thus reducing the bone turnover and resorption. In old age, as bone resorption outweighs the new bone formation, this is a beneficial response resulting in improved bone mass in osteoporosis. However, osteoclast inhibition also results in compromised natural repair capacity of the bone resulting in accumulation of the microdamage over time. Altered bone mineral and matrix composition due to reduced bone turn over results in increased mineral to matrix ratio (hypermineralisation) which are often visible on the radiograph as the thickened bone cortex. Reduced bone turnover also results in accumulation of the advanced glycation end products in the extracellular matrix and increased mean tissue age. These changes, although result in increased bone strength and stiffness, makes them brittle and susceptible to fractures.35,36 These brittle bones are more susceptible for tensile stresses which act along the lateral femoral cortex resulting in microdamage, which in turn may progress to fracture along the lateral femoral shaft. It has been described that biomechanical forces may result in micromotions at the early fracture site preventing its healing.36 Specific variant geometries in the hip and femur such as varus angle of the femoral neck, narrow centre-edge angle and high BMI have been described to be associated with the development of atypical femur fracture in long-term bisphosphonate users37 (Supplementary Figure 2).\\n\\nSupplementary Figure 2.

Classical AFF is located along the lateral cortex of femur in the femoral diaphysis with a transverse fracture line occurring with no or minimal trauma. When the fracture line involves periosteum or endosteum, there may be periosteal/endosteal thickening (Figure 9). Focal cortical thickening is also seen at the fracture site. This, along with the transverse orientation of the fracture line is considered as the most sensitive, specific and accurate criteria in diagnosing bisphosphonate-related AFF38 and has shown to be useful in differentiating AFF from other fractures involving the lateral cortex such as a Banana fracture in Paget’s disease.38\\n\\nFigure 9.

Pathological fractures in femur are usually secondary to metastatic lesions and subtrochanteric femur is commonest location. Primary bone tumours are responsible for only 6% of pathological fractures. MRI is a reliable imaging modality to identify and differentiate pathological fracture from non-pathological or stress fracture and T1 images are vital. T2 and fluid sensitive sequences are non-specific due to the presence of excessive marrow oedema and surrounding inflammation.\\n\\nThey can be characterised from stress fractures by the presence of a well-defined T1 hypointense lesion at the fracture site completely replacing the marrow fat, ill-defined fracture line due to the tumour tissue eroding the bone trabeculae, endosteal scalloping, presence of soft tissue component and presence of necrotic component in enhancing soft tissues. In stress fractures, oedema tends to be ill-defined and irregular with interspersed marrow fat on T1 images. Pathological fractures are common in metaphysis, whereas stress fractures frequently involve diaphysis. In adults, an avulsion fracture of lesser trochanter is considered pathological unless proved otherwise.1,40,41'),\n",

A stress fracture appears as a linear infraction in the centre of an area of surrounding cortical thickening osteoid osteoma conversely appears as a round nidus.43 On follow-up radiograph, the size of the stress fracture may reduce, whereas osteoid osteoma will remain stable. MRI may demonstrate marrow oedema and linear fracture line if present, in stress fracture. In osteoid osteoma of the femoral neck, MRI may demonstrate a half-moon shaped oedema pattern with the base along the cortex of the femoral neck referred to as “half-moon sign”.44 CT remains the investigation of choice to demonstrate the nidus in the osteoid osteoma45 and useful to differentiate it from a stress fracture. (Figure 12) On scintigraphy, a stress fracture shows intense tracer uptake of linear morphology, osteoid osteoma, on the other hand, displays intense central tracer uptake representing nidus with the surrounding area of moderate tracer uptake donating areas of increased osteoblastic activity, overall known as the “double-density” sign44 (Table 5).\\n\\nFigure 12.

A content analysis examined how IMD blood and urine tests were described online in local healthcare sectors between May and June 2021. Among the nine resources, four were blood test providers and five were urine test providers. All mentioned the test benefits and procedures. Other information, such as false-positive/negative or risk of pain, was infrequently mentioned. The descriptions of urine tests are advertised as outperforming blood tests and can be purchased from commercial laboratory sites without medical guidance. Two urine test providers claimed no false results were reported. A few commercial advertisements highlighted the simplicity of the urine test and potentially overstated the invasiveness of the blood test. We found that some advertisements described IMD as “silent killers” and emphasised the advantage of getting “reassurance” in controlling the child’s developmental health and well-being. To better protect the parents, or broadly, the public interest, regulatory and oversight measures on the urine tests should be implemented to promote the proper use of genetic tests. Without timely regulation and oversight, the incorrect descriptions might create a public misconception about utilising these commercial laboratory tests to inform health decisions.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmc1. Introduction\\n\\nInherited metabolic diseases (IMD) are a group of genetic disorders arising from the inherent deficiency of a certain enzyme or cofactor that impairs normal metabolism. Accumulation of excessive toxic substances or deficiency of essential metabolites in the body may damage vital organs, posing a significant risk of morbidity and mortality to patients. A small proportion of IMD can be diagnosed and treated early with diet therapy or pharmacotherapy and may benefit significantly from disease monitoring. As initial symptoms for treatable conditions, e.g., vomiting and characteristic odours [1], are often non-specific and non-exclusive, IMD conditions are likely to be under-detected before symptomatic manifestation. Delayed detection and diagnosis can result in poor health prognosis, severe medical conditions, physical or mental developmental problems, and even death, posing a heavy toll on individuals and the health care system.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Most developed countries have placed great emphasis on extensive IMD screening programmes for treatable conditions to prevent significant developmental delay or severe morbidity and mortality in individuals with treatable IMD conditions. The advancement of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has led to the rapid development of expanded newborn IMD screening programmes [2], which can efficiently identify infants at increased risk for the conditions in question, enabling specific diagnostic testing and early treatment if warranted to allow for the best possible outcome. The heel-prick blood test (herein blood test) is the most frequently deployed method, examining the subject’s blood sample collected on a filter paper card. The number of disorders screened varies by country, depending on funding, regulations, techniques used, and disease prevalence in the population [3]. Although there are no universal criteria for conditions to be included in the screenings, there is consensus around Wilson and Jungner’s classic screening criteria [4,5] that the screened diseases should have (i) a well-defined natural history, (ii) a high disease prevalence in the general population, (iii) increased mortality and morbidity rates when left untreated, and (iv) effective medical treatment and management plans, such that the results of the screening are meaningful and conducive to improving the health of affected individuals. In the context of newborn screening, disease prevalence is not one of the criteria. Screening a rare disease in the absence of an accepted treatment may be appropriate when it will provide a net benefit to the child or the family [6].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Parental use of the internet to seek health information related to screening is frequently observed during pregnancy [7] and newborn screening processes [8,9,10]. Araia and Potter [11] assessed the content quality of online North American websites on newborn screening programmes and reported an imbalanced emphasis on benefits rather than potential harms. The majority of materials mentioned the purpose and benefits of screening, descriptions of the screening process, and the conditions to be tested. Few sources included information on the possibility of receiving a false-positive or false-negative result, the need for diagnostic follow-up, or the storage or disposal policy of the collected blood spot sample. Although parents often go online and seek information, it is uncertain how they process the online information that determines their health behaviour, such as test uptake or refusal. Given that the internet is one of the most popular sources for medical information among parents, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the advertised IMD tests play an essential role in parents’ decision-making, their understanding of the test results, and, eventually, the health of the next generation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In Hong Kong, IMD are common among recognised rare diseases with an incidence rate of 1 in 1376 [12]. In response to public health concerns, in 2015, government-subsidised hospitals instituted a territory-wide newborn metabolic diseases screening programme. Participation in the programme is completely voluntary. Testing, counselling, and follow-up services are centralised at Hong Kong Children’s Hospital. Prior to the launch of the universal screening programme, only newborn cord blood test screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and congenital hypothyroidism was offered to all newborns free of charge at birth. IMD screening was available only as a pay-per-service test performed in the private healthcare sector. Patients diagnosed with IMD require care from a multidisciplinary team with medical, nursing, and dietetic specialities. Alternatively, IMD screening using blood tests can be done in private clinics and hospitals. The IMD screening using urine tests can be purchased, primarily via the internet, as a self-expensed test. Urine tests were widely used in the early years of the public health programme to screen for certain conditions such as phenylketonuria, by detecting phenyl ketones in the urine. However, they were later replaced by blood tests for higher sensitivity [13,14].\\n\\nThe study objectives are to (1) map the local adoption of IMD screening using blood and urine tests in local public and private sectors, including public hospitals, private hospitals, a university-affiliated private clinic, and commercial laboratories; and (2) evaluate the comprehensiveness of the corresponding published resources.\\n\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n\\n2.1.

Content analysis is an iterative process of capturing an objective, systematic, and quantitative description of the manifest content of the communication [15,16]. As a research method, it provides a systematic and objective framework to analyse cross-sectional information in all types of documents. It is widely used in various specialities, including antenatal genetic tests [17] and cancer medicine [18]. This study included information pamphlets and websites written in Chinese and/or English, the two official languages of Hong Kong.

The information pamphlet for analysis was gathered from the Department of Health website (Document number: NBSIMD/1-60-2/04).\\n\\n3.1.2. Private Sectors\\n\\nFor those newborns delivered at non-public hospitals, parents need to conduct the test out-of-pocket at private service sectors, including commercial genetic laboratories, university-affiliated hospitals, or private hospitals.\\n\\nCommercial Laboratories\\n\\nTo identify the commercial laboratories offering IMD screening, we conducted systematic searches using two internet search engines—Google Hong Kong and Yahoo—to avoid bias associated with one specific engine. Keywords for internet searches of commercial genetic laboratories were derived from the terminology in the clinical guidelines published in the government documents and the Hospital Authority. The following items used to retrieve relevant articles were designed to include locally appropriate context: (1) newborn screening, (2) Newborn Metabolic Screening Programme, (3) metabolic disorder/disease, or (4) inborn errors of metabolism.\\n\\nIn the end, seven commercial laboratory websites were identified from the online search. Of these, two laboratories offered blood test screening for 48 conditions, and four provided urine test screening for up to 158 conditions.

This service is available to private obstetric or paediatric referrals. Downloadable brochures are available on the university’s website.

The team gathered information on the hospital websites. Then, the team wrote an enquiry email and phoned the hotline to collect data from hospitals about information not provided publicly on the internet. A sample of the enquiry email is as follows: (1) Does the hospital provide tests for inborn errors of metabolism? (2) Is it a urine or blood test? (3) How many conditions can be tested? What are the conditions tested? (4) Is the screening limited to inpatient services only?\\n\\nThe two non-maternity hospitals did not provide the test and were excluded.\\n\\nAmongst the ten maternity hospitals, only two provided separate pamphlets on IMD blood tests on their hospital website.

None of the materials included all 14 recommended messages, with a mean of 6.67 messages (SD = 0.42).

In addition, all noted that the featured benefits of blood tests were early detection and early treatment (n = 4, 100%).\\n\\nAll resources detailed the test procedure of the newborn IMD screening. The blood test must be performed in clinics or hospitals and needs to be done in a short window of time. Two sources offering blood tests suggested that it be performed within 24 to 72 h after birth (50%), and another two (50%) suggested after 24 h and up to the 7th day of life.

       " Document(page_content='4. Discussion\\n\\nThis study found that expanded newborn metabolic screening has been disseminated across various healthcare sectors at parents’ disposal with or without professional healthcare assistance. Echoing a North American study [11], our findings showed that most sources were inclined to focus on the benefits and were less likely to highlight the risks or test limitations. For instance, the urine test providers rarely mentioned false-positive or false-negative results or the necessity of a follow-up diagnosis. Other unaddressed essential information included the risk of pain and incidental findings, which, though uncommon, demand attention. As opposed to the claim of having virtually perfect accuracy, screening tests always carry the risk of false results. In a local 18-month prospective study, two mothers were incidentally picked up with IMD of carnitine uptake deficiency (CUD) and classic phenylketonuria [12]. False-negative cases were also reported [20,21]. The complexity of genetic information from IMD screening accentuates the pivotal role of healthcare professionals in pre-test and post-test counselling to explain the meanings of different results.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We observed some variabilities and incorrect descriptions in introducing the urine tests, both within and across the resources. A few highlighted the simplicity of the urine test and potentially overstated the invasiveness of the blood test. Urine tests also claimed to screen for four times as many conditions as blood tests (150+ and 25+ conditions; see Appendix A and Appendix B). The majority of the screenable conditions are outside of the core panel recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics [22]. Some conditions advertised in the urine test may have been recommended to be identified using the more sensitive dried blood spot card over urine (e.g., phenylketonuria) [13]. Some conditions detected may turn out to be benign, with symptoms often ameliorating and disappearing naturally during follow-up (e.g., Short-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency) [23]. Some commercial labs claim that urine can be used to perform protein or glucose screening and screen for rare non-childhood conditions such as Meigs syndrome and gestational diabetes mellitus.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Of additional concern, our findings reported that sources incorrectly described the urine test as diagnostic in nature for some diseases that are more sensitive to a blood test (e.g., pyridoxine-5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) Deficiency). It is vital to note that the heel prick blood test using MS/MS is proven to be a more efficient and cost-effective technique [24]. The blood test is the standardised method adopted by most, if not all, national screening programmes, including in Hong Kong. The urine test is a diagnostic test for a limited scope of IMD only and not a replacement for conventional blood tests. Most urine-based IMD screenings remained in the research phase, and some were reported to be not sensitive enough for screening [25]. More evidence must be accumulated before these tests are marketed commercially. The healthcare community came to a consensus that blood-based IMD by MS/MS is a good screening test and may require further diagnostic tests. Local tertiary hospital protocols and guidelines listed specific two-tiered approaches and strategic steps to best eliminate inaccurate reporting of results. Appropriate follow-up and professional referral mechanisms should be made available. Further tests as confirmation should always be considered when the first-line tests indicate an increased risk of an IMD. On the opposite end, some commercial laboratory genetic tests that claim to be all-in-one screening and diagnostic tools can thus create a misconception in parents and delay their seeking medical advice.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Hong Kong Chinese parents always want the best care to reassure them about their child’s health. About three-fifths of pregnancies were delivered in the public sector [26], implying that two-fifths of newborn mothers delivered in the private sectors, not benefitting from free-of-charge IMD screening. The latter group are more likely under the influence of commercial resources to take the IMD test. These urine test services are advertised predominantly on the internet and available online at parents’ own choice and expense without medical guidance. The popular notion of “the more you know about the child, the better” is commonly reported among parents for better planning regarding the child’s development [27]. Without a comprehensive understanding of what conditions are necessary to be screened, parents may be under the impression that a greater number of screenable conditions would be the best option.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nZayts and Luo [28] studied the language used by commercial laboratories in Hong Kong. They found that online materials tend to use sentimental terms or make inflated claims about the value of genetic tests to pursue a marketing agenda. In concordance with the results of Zayts and Luo, we found that some advertisements described IMD as “silent killers” and emphasised the advantage of getting “reassurance” in controlling the child’s developmental health and well-being. The use of storytelling and linguistic foregrounding is prevalent and potentially biased in promoting health, making targeted advertisement audiences relatable to these shared parental responsibilities, emotions, and narratives. It is unsurprising that the public may have been misled easily and overestimated the utility of the commercial laboratory test. Making an informed choice under the influence of biased information and in the absence of health care providers is also questionable, especially considering the Hong Kong Chinese population has attained a low genomic literacy [29]. Genetic counsellors’ views towards any commercial laboratory tests were nuanced. They asserted that these commercial tests should be provided responsibly with appropriate access to information, an informed consent process, and professional advice [30]. To better protect the parents, or broadly, the public interest, the Steering Committee on Genomic Medicine issued strategic plans for developing genomic medicine. One of the scopes is to recommend pre-testing consultation with qualified healthcare professionals [31]. In Hong Kong, the development of genetic counselling as a licensing profession is lagging behind compared with other developed regions and countries [32]. Recognising the limited capacities in clinical genetics and bioinformatics, the Steering Committee recommended that academic institutes offer relevant internationally certified programmes to meet the burgeoning service demand [31]. Another indicative action is promoting the proper use of genetic and genomic tests. Implementing additional regulatory measures on commercial tests from a top-down approach is crucial yet complex, varying by country. For example, France and Germany ban commercial genetic tests and mandate the involvement of healthcare professionals in any genetic examination [33]. Like many regions and countries, Hong Kong does not provide legislation governing commercial laboratory tests. These tests are recognised as goods under the law unless false trade descriptions and inaccurate, misleading or incomplete information regarding the goods provided are evident. Without timely regulation and oversight, the incorrect descriptions might create a public misconception about utilising these commercial laboratory tests to inform health decisions.'),\n",

Vesicles are now thought to mediate cellular communication, transmission of some diseases and pathologically mediated calcification. Matrix vesicles have long been proposed to be central to the controlled mineralisation of bone. They remain relatively poorly studied, however, since they are challenging to extract from biological media. One difficulty is the presence of a mineral content in comparison to pure lipid vesicles, meaning that standard separation process such as ultracentrifugation are unable to precisely separate on the basis of size or weight. In this paper we report the separation of matrix vesicles from an organotypic bone culture system using a process of immunoprecipitation. Matrix vesicles were extracted using polymeric beads that were modified with an antibody for tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNALP), a surface marker abundant in bone-derived vesicles. The vesicles isolated were positive for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the substrate for TNALP and were demonstrated to have a high-binding affinity to type I collagen, the principal collagen type found in bone. This protocol enables more detailed study of the process and regulation of mineralisation.\\n\\nCellular nanovesicles have been shown to play a significant role in many biological processes. Organotypic bone culture systems are a source of physiologically-relevant mineralisation vesicles, which can be immuno-selected for investigation.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmcIntroduction\\n\\nThe process of ossification takes places through a cell-mediated route, where cartilaginous matrix built by chondrocytic and osteoblastic cells becomes mineralised in an organised manner, ultimately giving rise to the mature bone tissue.1 It is generally accepted that the process of calcium and phosphate deposition in cartilage, bone and dentin is mediated by exosome/vesicle-like nano-structures, generally referred to as matrix vesicles (MVs).2–4 These nanovesicles are thought to bud off from the plasma membrane of hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts5 and contain a combination of compounds which allow the localised deposition of hydroxyapatite (or a poorly crystalline apatite), which ultimately becomes precipitated on the surface of collagen fibrils,2,6 forming nucleation points7 for further mineral growth.\\n\\nThe selection of specific vesicles present in the environment of cells which are actively involved in building the bone matrix (i.e. osteoblasts and osteocytes) can be useful for further understanding the ossification process during both physiological and aberrant states.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nThis has been an area of intense research in the past years and numerous methods have become available for selecting these nanostructures for further characterisation, each presenting various advantages and disadvantages.8 Traditional protocols for selecting these small vesicles involve ultracentrifugation (UC),9 which allows the separation of matrix vesicles on the basis that larger particles sediment faster, while the smaller particles remain in the supernatant and can be recovered using further centrifugation steps. In the case of matrix vesicles, the mineral phase contained by the vesicles increases their weight such that they pellet at a faster rate.9 Whilst this method can produce a high yield of nanovesicles, the selection of nano-sized structures solely on this basis presents significant disadvantages such the inability to remove similar exosomes of equal weight;10 deformations and damage associated with the centrifugation process, such as exosomal aggregation,11 which can potentially impact proteomic and RNA content analysis12,13 as well as inconsistencies related to using the same protocol with different rotors.14 Moreover, subsequent characterisation techniques used to confirm the nature of exosomes isolated through differential ultracentrifugation, such as visualisation using TEM, which has been traditionally used to observe these structures at high resolution, is not always able to confirm the nature of vesicles due to artefacts associated with the sample preparation process for TEM, which causes dehydration and collapse of vesicles;8,12 and the presence of matrix vesicles lacking a mineral phase.5,15,16 Therefore, methods which can select these vesicles based on consistently described markers in their composition are more reliable and appropriate indicators of their presence in the mineralising matrix and for further description of their biological role. Markers involved in ossification, abundantly present on the surface of these matrix vesicles, such as tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP)4,17–19 can be targeted and used for immuno-isolation using standard immunoprecipitation protocols.20,21 Although a much smaller population can be selected using this procedure, the presence of ossification markers on nano-sized vesicles can provide confirmation on their actual identity as well as involvement in the biomineralization process.'),\n",

In vitro, this technique can be a straightforward process, given the high number of osteoblastic cells that can be cultured in 2D. However, the lack of a three-dimensional environment and of a bone-like surrounding matrix may influence the physiological relevance of the collected vesicles. 3D cultures of osteoblastic cells can provide an ideal alternative to generate a rich source of vesicles which can be collected for analysis. Recently, we have developed an organotypic model of mature bone,22 which allows long-term culture of bone tissue, in excess of 1 year, and which shows a biochemical composition and structural organisation similar to mature bone at the centimetre scale.

Deactivating defects in the TNAP gene in mice show matrix vesicles which do contain a mineral phase but are unable to self-nucleate and generate further crystal growth due to high-amounts of pyrophosphate, leading to symptoms similar to the hereditary condition hypophosphatasia,4,18,19,27 as well as rickets, osteomalacia and spontaneous fractures.\\n\\nAs such, the membrane-associated TNAP was targeted for immuno-capturing mineralisation nanovesicles and a schematic of the isolation system used to purify populations of nanostructures with similar characteristics to matrix vesicles is presented in Fig. 1. The method involved building an isolation complex by coupling TNAP monoclonal IgG antibodies (Ab) to recombinant protein G (17 kDa), which was covalently bound to the surface of 2.8 μm superparamagnetic beads (MBs). During a 15 minutes incubation at room temperature in PBS-Tween 20, the antibodies became bound via their Fc regions to the beads, leaving the Fab regions on the antibodies available to bind TNAP on the outer surface of vesicles.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nBackground\\nThe key sensor of extracellular ionised calcium (Ca) is the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR); the key physiological actions being regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release from the parathyroid glands and calcium reabsorption from the renal tubules [1].\\n\\nInactivating mutations of the CaSR gene reduce the receptor sensitivity to Ca resulting in increased PTH secretion, reduced renal calcium excretion, and hypercalcaemia. Bi-allelic CaSR mutations typically lead to neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) [2].\\n\\nThe standard therapy for NSHPT is total parathyroidectomy [3]. Recent preliminary reports suggest improved outcomes with contemporaneous parathyroid auto-transplantation [4]. Here we describe a Sri Lankan infant with NHSPT due to a homozygous CaSR mutation who was successfully treated at 3 months of age by total parathyroidectomy and contemporaneous parathyroid auto-transplantation.\\n\\nCase presentation and results\\nA 10-day old neonate presented with low-grade fever, poor feeding, reduced activity and constipation of 3-day duration. There were no associated seizures. He was born at term with a birth weight of 3.6kg to second-degree consanguineous parents and had no family history of hypercalcaemia, bone disease, or renal stones. On admission, he was lethargic and hypotonic, and had moderate dehydration with a 30% weight loss. No subcutaneous fat necrosis was felt.\\n\\nInvestigations revealed severe hypercalcaemia, low serum phosphorus, normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP), high serum intact parathormone (PTH) with a sufficient Vitamin-D level (Table 1). Radiographs of the hand and chest revealed generalised osteopenia and periosteal erosions without evidence of fractures.\\n\\nThe immediate management involved hyper-hydration and intravenous furosemide, followed by IV pamidronate administration, resulting in an improvement in hypercalcaemia, the infant’s symptoms and weight. He was discharged on oral furosemide.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='At 6 weeks of age, furosemide was stopped as hypercalcaemia worsened and a trial of cinacalcet was initiated (1.5 mg/kg/d). Increasing cinacalcet doses (maximum dose 11mg/kg/day) failed to show a sustained response, therefore at 3 months of age and with a body weight of only 3.6 kg, surgery was performed. The PTH level had increased to 1744 pg/ml. During surgery, the paediatric surgeon identified four enlarged parathyroid glands and 24 hours after total parathyroidectomy serum PTH was undetectable. Half of a parathyroid gland was re-implanted under the left biceps muscle.\\n\\nCalcitriol which was started postoperatively was gradually reduced and totally eliminated at 16-weeks post-surgery. Serum calcium and PTH (16 pg/mL) were normal, but serum phosphorus was elevated, suggesting mild parathyroid insufficiency. Serum calcium remained normal till 18-months postoperatively when hypocalcaemia with a low PTH level was detected, and calcitriol was re-started.\\n\\nAfter surgery the child showed impressive catch up growth, and at 18-months his neurodevelopment was age-appropriate. There was no biochemical or radiological evidence in renal ultrasound of hypercalciuria secondary to calcium therapy.\\n\\nAfter parathyroidectomy the diagnosis of NSHPT was confirmed by genetic testing that revealed a previously reported (3) homozygous nonsense mutation in CaSR: NM_000388.3: c.679 C>T: p. R227X which predicts a truncated protein that would be non-responsive to calcimimetic therapy. Both parents were heterozygous carriers. Family screening of 1st degree relatives revealed normocalcemia and normocalciuria (Table 1).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Discussion\\nNSHPT is a rare genetic disorder which presents in the first few weeks of life with poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia, respiratory distress and failure to thrive, all of which are non-specific symptoms and signs of common neonatal problems [2]. Failure to recognise the problem early and initiate appropriate treatment promptly is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and a mortality rate of greater than 50% [3].\\n\\nIn the absence of widely-available rapid molecular testing, a diagnosis relied on identifying the typical clinical presentation and biochemistry. A typical presentation and severe hypercalcaemia in an infant born to consanguineous parents were highly suggestive of NHSPT, and further testing which revealed high PTH levels and typical radiological features was highly suggestive in our patient.\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis of neonatal hypercalcaemia includes idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia, William syndrome, subcutaneous fat necrosis, vitamin D intoxication and hypophosphatasia; all of which are associated with low PTH levels.\\n\\nCinacalcet is an allosteric activator of the CaSR, increasing its sensitivity to extracellular calcium leading to a decrease in PTH output. Homozygous inactivating mutations of CaSR are known to be non-responders to calcimimetics [5], as seen in our patient.\\n\\nIn patients whom cinacalcet was successful, a significant calcium reduction was seen within a couple of days. A dramatic response in the PTH and calcium levels were seen 2 days after cinacalcet (0.4mg/kg/day) [6]. Therefore, in the absence of rapidly-available genetic testing, a lack of response to a trial of cinacalcet should suggest homozygous mutations.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of recognising a rare disorder associated with non-specific manifestations and initiating timely and appropriate specialized management in order to achieve desirable outcomes. Furthermore, in the absence of rapid molecular evaluation, a short trial of cinacalcet is desirable. Failure to show a dramatic reduction in calcium levels within a few days of initiating cinacalcet should indicate the need for total parathyroidectomy, which is life-saving.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nDr S.

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nHypophosphatasia is a rare heritable metabolic disorder caused by deficient Tissue Non-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (TNAP) enzyme activity. A principal function of TNAP is to hydrolyze the tissue mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. ENPP1 (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1) is a primary enzymatic generator of pyrophosphate and prior results showed that elimination of ENPP1 rescued bone hypomineralization of skull, vertebral and long bones to different extents in TNAP null mice. Current TNAP enzyme replacement therapy alleviates skeletal, motor and cognitive defects but does not eliminate craniosynostosis in pediatric hypophosphatasia patients. To further understand mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis development in hypophosphatasia, here we sought to determine if craniofacial abnormalities including craniosynostosis and skull shape defects would be alleviated in TNAP null mice by genetic ablation of ENPP1. Results show that homozygous deletion of ENPP1 significantly diminishes the incidence of craniosynostosis and that skull shape abnormalities are rescued by hemi- or homozygous deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice. Skull and long bone hypomineralization were also alleviated in TNAP−/−/ENPP1−/− compared to TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice, though loss of ENPP1 in combination with TNAP had different effects than loss of only TNAP on long bone trabeculae. Investigation of a relatively large cohort of mice revealed that the skeletal phenotypes of TNAP null mice were markedly variable. Because FGF23 circulating levels are known to be increased in ENPP1 null mice and because FGF23 influences bone, we measured serum intact FGF23 levels in the TNAP null mice and found that a subset of TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice exhibited markedly high serum FGF23. Serum FGF23 levels also correlated to mouse body measurements, the incidence of craniosynostosis, skull shape abnormalities and skull bone density and volume fraction. Together, our results demonstrate that balanced expression of TNAP and ENPP1 enzymes are essential for microstructure and mineralization of both skull and long bones, and for preventing craniosynostosis. The results also show that FGF23 rises in the TNAP−/− model of murine lethal hypophosphatasia. Future studies are required to determine if the rise in FGF23 is a cause, consequence, or marker of disease phenotype severity.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmcINTRODUCTION\\n\\nTissue Non-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (TNAP, Alpl) is a membrane-tethered dephosphorylating enzyme. In humans and mice, TNAP is expressed in bone, growth plate cartilage, teeth, brain, kidney and liver (1–3). While the function(s) of TNAP in liver, kidney and brain are still being established (4–7), numerous prior studies have established that TNAP is an essential promoter of tissue mineralization when co-expressed with type I collagen in mineralized tissues (8–11). The primary known function of TNAP in tissue mineralization is to promote calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite crystal growth in pre-mineralized cartilaginous matrix (osteoid) by decreasing levels of the mineralization inhibitor, inorganic pyrophosphate, and by dephosphorylating osteopontin (12–15).\\n\\nEctonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1, Enpp1) was first identified as an ectoenzyme that generates inorganic pyrophosphate via the hydrolysis of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars (16, 17). Data from both mouse and human studies supports the fact that ENPP1 is essential for control of both hard and soft tissue mineralization. As stated above, pyrophosphate itself inhibits tissue mineralization (18, 19). This is well evidenced by the fact that homozygous ENPP1 deficiency in humans leads to a severe form of vascular calcification (GACI; Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy) and that loss of function mutations in ENPP1 leads to spine stiffening (OPLL, Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament), both of which are recapitulated in mouse models (20–23). Through as yet unknown mechanisms, ENPP1 deficiency also causes osteomalacia and osteoporosis in both humans and mice (24–28).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Deficient expression and/or activity of TNAP enzyme in humans causes a rare, heritable disorder called hypophosphatasia (HPP). Hypophosphatasia in humans has a broad range of severity that corresponds with timing of onset. Symptoms range from lethal and/or severe with perinatal or infantile onset (29), to modest and milder forms with childhood and adult onset (30, 31). Through a series of preclinical studies conducted on the Alpl−/− mouse model of infantile hypophosphatasia (TNAP−/− mice), a mineral-targeted recombinant form of TNAP was developed (32, 33). This recombinant enzyme was initially tested in patients with life threatening disease and was shown to improve respiratory function, skeletal mineralization and survival in patients with severe perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia (34, 35). More recent results confirm safety and longer-term efficacy of this enzyme replacement therapy. In a 7 year follow up to the original trial, skeletal healing was sustained with additional improvements over time in treatment for respiratory function, weight, height, fine motor, gross motor and cognitive skills (36). While this drug is clearly life rescuing and life changing for severely affected hypophosphatasia patients, symptoms such as muscle weakness and craniosynostosis (the premature fusion of growing cranial bones) are not alleviated with treatment (37).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='It is not known why or how craniosynostosis develops in hypophosphatasia, nor why this aspect of the disorder is not diminished upon recombinant enzyme treatment initiated even shortly after birth in humans. We previously showed that craniosynostosis in the form of coronal suture fusion and associated skull shape abnormalities develop in the TNAP−/− mouse model of infantile hypophosphatasia (38). Based upon prior studies showing rescue of skeletal mineralization upon genetic ablation of the inorganic pyrophosphate generating enzyme ENPP1 (13), here we sought to determine if the craniofacial skeletal abnormalities of TNAP−/− mice are alleviated upon genetic ablation of ENPP1. Because the phenotype of TNAP−/− was so variable and because FGF23 was previously shown to be high in ENPP1 null mice, here we also investigated circulating levels of intact FGF23 in the single and double mutant mice. Results demonstrate that normalization of pyrophosphate levels in TNAP−/− mice rescues craniofacial and long bone abnormalities, and that severity of the TNAP−/− phenotype correlates with high serum FGF23 levels in these mice.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nAnimals'),\n",

TNAP+/−/ENPP1+/+ and TNAP+/+/ENPP1+/− mice were bred to generate wild type, single and double mutant mice. All mice were provided free access to modified laboratory rodent diet containing 325 pyridoxine because TNAP is needed for vitamin B6 metabolism (39). Gross skeletal phenotyping was performed by staining with alizarin red and alcian blue. Genotyping was performed by PCR using DNA samples from tail digests, as previously described (40, 41). Because TNAP−/− mice die at ~3 weeks postnatal, to minimize loss of animals due to premature death, mice were euthanized for phenotyping at day 17.

To account for differences in skull size between the mouse genotypes, skull measurements were normalized by a total skull length measurement (distance from nasale to opisthion). For size normalized measurements, skull length was measured from nasale to paro, skull width was measured between right and left intersections of the squamosal body to the zygomatic process of the squamous portion of the temporal bone, skull height was measured from pari to the inferior portion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, inner canthal distance was measured between right and left intersections of the frontal process of maxilla with frontal and lacrimal bones, nasal bone was measured from nasale to nasion, frontal bone length was measured from nasion to bregma and parietal bone length was measured from bregma to pari.

The phenotype of severe hypophosphatasia in mouse pups and human infants can also include craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of cranial bones leading to diminished skull growth, high intracranial pressure and an abnormal skull shape (29, 38, 49). Treatment of infants and children with severe hypophosphatasia using a recombinant, mineral-targeted form of TNAP has been highly successful for improving survival, and for rescuing bone mineralization plus motor and cognitive deficiencies. Unfortunately, the recombinant enzyme therapy has been less efficacious for preventing craniosynostosis (36). In this study we primarily sought to determine if ablation of the pyrophosphate generating enzyme, ENPP1, in TNAP null mice would rescue craniosynostosis and associated craniofacial skeletal abnormalities because deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice was previously shown to rescue skeletal mineralization (13) and to further understand mechanisms that mediate the craniofacial abnormalities in hypophosphatasia.'),\n",

It is worth noting that the 7-year follow up study on TNAP enzyme replacement in severely affected patients revealed that, despite enzyme replacement, the hypophosphatasia patients remained well below normal for both height and weight (36). TNAP enzyme replacement targets to mineralized tissues. It remains unknown if a TNAP function in non-mineralized tissues is responsible for the diminished body size seen in TNAP deficient mice and patients but recent studies indicate that TNAP does play a role in cell and body metabolism including brown fat thermogenesis (4, 41, 50).'),\n",

Cranial bone mineral density and volume fraction were also only normalized only upon homozygous and not hemizygous deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice. This data is consistent to the previously published data showing rescue of skull mineralization upon genetic ablation of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice, although quantification using multiple mice was not performed at that time (13). Together our data indicates that partial normalization of the TNAP-ENPP1 enzyme balance allowing for some expression of ENPP1 (and ENPP1 generated pyrophosphate) is adequate for normalizing craniofacial skeletal shape defects, and that the abnormalities in skull shape are not dependent upon either coronal suture fusion or cranial bone mineralization. Finally, frontal and parietal bone lengths that were increased in the TNAP null mice were also increased in TNAP−/−/ENPP1−/− mice, indicating that ENPP1 and/or ENPP1 generated PPi does not mediate the increased cranial bone lengths seen in these mice. Craniosynostosis has been proposed to occur downstream of changes in frontal and/or parietal bone growth (51).

Phosphate levels in media were diminished to a small but significant degree in all cells that lacked ENPP1 when other genotypes, indicating that ENPP1 is essential for generation of both phosphate and pyrophosphate when in the presence of TNAP or other pyrophosphatases. Phosphate levels in media were not diminished in TNAP null compared to wild type cells, though this may have been due to variation in the data. Consistent with our previously published results (38, 41, 46), we also found that cellular proliferation was decreased and cell metabolism was increased in TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ cells. Cell proliferation was not increased in TNAP−/−/ENPP1−/− compared to TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ cells. This data indicates that TNAP promotes cell proliferation via a mechanism that is independent of ENPP1 and associated pyrophosphate.

Serum FGF23 levels were highly variable in the TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice, with a subset of the mice at day 17 showing markedly high serum FGF23. Hemi- or homozygous deletion of ENPP1 lowered serum FGF23 levels in TNAP null mice (data not shown), indicating that high inorganic pyrophosphate levels may mediate the rise in FGF23. Because TNAP−/− mice exhibit a phenotype of severe hypophosphatasia by day 17, these levels could have been caused in some manner by the phenotype itself. Therefore, we next assayed FGF23 levels in day 5 mouse serum. While results of all mouse genotypes were more variable, likely due to the inability to withdraw food prior to assay in these young mice, we again found significantly increased circulating levels of intact FGF23. In addition, we found strong to moderately strong negative correlation between serum FGF23 levels and body size, and between serum FGF23 levels and cranial bone micro-CT parameters. We also found strong positive correlation between serum FGF23 levels and craniosynostosis plus skull shape abnormalities. In other words, high levels of FGF23 correlated with poor skull bone, decreased body size, incidence of craniosynostosis and skull shape defects. While high FGF23 levels are not evident in non-lethal pediatric hypophosphatasia patients (56) and in fact low levels of the phosphatonin FGF7 were reported in this population, the TNAP−/− mouse model of infantile hypophosphatasia exhibits a very severe and lethal hypophosphatasia phenotype. While entirely unanticipated, our data does demonstrate variably high serum intact FGF23 levels in this murine model of severe infantile hypophosphatasia and that high serum FGF23 correlates with severity of the phenotype. Questions remain in regards to if the FGF23 is a cause, consequence or simply a marker of phenotype severity in the TNAP−/− mice, and if FGF23 may also be relevant to lethal perinatal and/or infantile human hypophosphatasia.'),\n",

Biosilica is synthesized by a group of enzymes called silicateins, which mediate the formation of amorphous hydrated silica from monomeric precursors. The polymeric silicic acid formed by these enzymes, which have been cloned from various siliceous sponge species, then undergoes a maturation process to form a solid biosilica material. The second biomaterial, polyP, has the extraordinary property that it not only has morphogenetic activity similar to biosilica, i.e., can induce cell differentiation through specific gene expression, but also provides metabolic energy through enzymatic cleavage of its high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. This reaction is catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase, a ubiquitous enzyme that, in combination with adenylate kinase, forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from polyP. This article attempts to highlight the biomedical importance of the inorganic polymeric materials biosilica and polyP as well as the enzymes silicatein and alkaline phosphatase, which are involved in their metabolism or mediate their biological activity.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmc1. Introduction\\n\\nThe oxides of two physiological, non-carbon elements have aroused particular interest in manufacturing tissue engineering scaffolds: silicon and phosphorus. The oxides of these elements and their polymers, silica and polyphosphate (polyP), are involved in the formation of the biomineral skeletons of a large number of animal species, from sponges (silica) to vertebrates (calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite). While phosphorus is an essential element of life [1] and, as phosphate ion or phosphate group, has a multitude of functions in all organisms, including energy transfer [2,3], the function of silicon and silica, as a skeletal element, is mainly limited to siliceous sponges [4] and diatoms [5], in addition to plant phytoliths or silica bodies [6]. Nevertheless, silicon has been recognized as an essential trace element in many organisms including vertebrates, particularly for their bone formation [7,8].\\n\\nToday it is widely accepted that biological mineralization or biomineralization processes, in contrast to purely chemical mineralization, begin with the formation of amorphous minerals. Crystalline biominerals such as bone hydroxyapatite are formed from the amorphous precursors [9]. This is important with regards to the potential use of (bio)minerals for the regeneration of bone tissue, since only the amorphous minerals such as amorphous silica, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), but not the crystalline minerals show morphogenetic, osteoblastic activity, both in vitro and in vivo (for reviews see [10,11]).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that, in animals, biomineral formation is largely enzyme-catalyzed. This has been shown in recent years for the principle classes of biominerals, for silica, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite. Amorphous silica (“biosilica”) is synthesized by the enzyme silicatein (formation of the silica skeleton of the siliceous sponges; [12]), ACC by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase [10] and ACP by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [3]. From these amorphous biominerals the crystalline minerals arise, such as calcite from ACC (formation of the calcite skeleton of the calcareous sponges) or hydroxyapatite (HA) in bones from ACP. In the latter case, it has even been shown that two biomineralization processes work closely together. The formation of HA is initiated by the deposition of biocatalytically formed ACC (carbonic anhydrase-mediated), which is then converted into ACP (involvement of ALP) and finally into crystalline HA (non-enzymatic) [11]. The phosphate used for the formation of ACP from ACC is supplied by polyP, as well as β-glycerophosphate. In contrast, biomineral deposition in non-animal organisms appears to be largely non-enzymatic, such as in diatoms and plants [5,6].\\n\\nBesides the enzymes that synthesize the polymeric material, such as silicatein, which forms silica from monomeric precursors, the enzymes that degrade these materials are likewise important. Some of these enzymes, such as the bacterial polyP kinases, show both polymerizing and depolymerizing activity [13] or are involved in regeneration of metabolic energy needed for tissue function [3]. Due to their prominent role in the formation and function of materials that are of interest in biomineral-based approaches in regenerative medicine, the two basic enzymes present in animals, silicatein and ALP, as well as their application in tissue repair are discussed in more detail.\\n\\n2. Differential Characteristics of the Si-O-Si and P-O-P Linkages'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The properties of the Si-O-Si bond in silica, formed by silicatein, and of the P-O-P bond in polyP, cleaved by ALP, are quite different. While polyP is a stable polymer in aqueous solution in the neutral pH range, polysilicic acids are only stable at alkaline pH values [14]. The phosphoanhydride (P-O-P) bond in polyP, but not the siloxane (Si-O-Si) bond in silica, can be used for metabolic energy production. Due to its kinetic stability at physiological pH, polyP can act both as a storage and as a donor of metabolic energy, the release of which requires an enzyme, which lowers the activation energy (the ALP) or a decrease in pH (acidic pH) [3]. The differing behavior of the Si-O-Si and P-O-P bonds is reflected in the different activation energies (Ea) for the hydrolysis of these bonds, which are much higher for P-O-P (Ea > 104 kJ·mol−1, in neutral solution) [15] than for the hydrolysis of the Si-O-Si bond, which ranges from 50–70 kJ·mol−1 [16,17]. The Ea of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the P-O-P bond, on the other hand, is only 57 kJ/mol [15]. It is to be expected that an enzyme such as silicatein also lowers the activation energy of the silica polymerization reaction (calculated Ea for the non-enzymatic Si-O-Si bond formation in neutral solution, 127 kJ·mol−1 [18]). The latter, non-enzymatic reaction proceeds via a transition state with the formation of a five-coordinated Si species and simultaneous proton transfer, resulting in the release of water [19]. The monomeric building blocks of polyP and of the polymeric silica also differ significantly in their pKa values, which for orthophosphate are pKa 2.2, 7.2 and 12.4 [20]; for orthosilicate the lowest pKa is 9.5 [20].\\n\\n3. Silicatein and Biosilica Formation'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Silicatein is an enzyme that is exceptional for its unmatched property of catalyzing the synthesis of an inorganic material from inorganic monomeric precursors [12,21]. The existence of such an enzyme was new and unexpected. Silica, the product of the enzyme reaction, is an amorphous material that consists of a network of SiO4 tetrahedra connected to one another by Si-O-Si bonds with a varying range of angles. It differs from quartz, the crystalline form of silicon dioxide. Silica is a thermodynamically metastable material. It remains amorphous at temperatures below the glass transition temperature Tg = 1480 K, in contrast to the melt, which is obtained above the melting temperature Tm = 1986 K [22].\\n\\nThe silica synthesizing enzyme, silicatein, actually presents two enzyme activities: a hydrolase activity and a polymerase activity (Figure 1A). The hydrolase activity was first described by the group of Morse [23,24]. This activity of silicatein is responsible for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), a synthetic ester of orthosilicic acid. The enzymatic nature of the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester linkage was demonstrated by the finding that the reaction follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the Michaelis constant (Km), determined for bis(p-aminophenoxy)-dimethylsilane, is 22.7 μM [21]. It has been suggested that the monomeric orthosilicic acid product generated during this reaction begins to polymerize, leading to the formation of silica deposits [24].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 1C shows a structural model of a silicatein molecule with the catalytic triad amino acids serine (Ser), histidine (His), and asparagine (Asn) forming the active site of the enzyme. The silicateins are related to the cathepsin family of proteases, which contain the three amino acids, cysteine (Cys), His and Asn, in their active center. In the silicateins, the Cys residue is replaced by a Ser residue [23]. In the immature silicatein protein, the catalytic site of the enzyme is covered by a propeptide sequence. Only after the cleavage of this sequence is this site accessible for the substrate and the catalytic reaction can proceed.\\n\\nInitially, the immediate product of silicatein reaction was believed to be a solid material [24]. However, it was soon found that this product is made up of soluble silicic acid polymers or a water-rich gel-like silica material that has to undergo a maturation process to become a hard, solid material. This process leads to the formation of solid silica structures such as the spicules of the siliceous sponge skeletons and is described in more detail further below.\\n\\n3.1. Mechanism of Silicatein Reaction\\n\\nSilicatein catalyzes the biosilica condensation reaction of its natural substrate orthosilicic acid or its synthetic precursor TEOS even at concentrations of <1 mM [25], which is lower than those required for the polycondensation of orthosilicic acid to occur (>1 mM) [26,27]. Therefore, the polycondensation reaction at low precursor concentrations, ambient-temperature, and near-neutral pH conditions usually used in assays to determine silicatein activity cannot be explained by a mechanism only based on a catalytic hydrolysis reaction (hydrolysis of TEOS) as described by Morse [24]. To explain the silica polymerase activity of silicatein, we proposed an alternative model [28].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Modelling and docking studies suggested that the biocatalytic reaction of silicatein with its natural substrate, orthosilicate, leads to the formation of cyclic trisilicic acid species. The cyclic silicic acid trimer [trisiloxane; (SiO)3(OH)6] has a significantly higher reactivity than monomeric silicic acid and can start the further condensation reactions [28]. Similarly to the model proposed by the group of Morse [24,29], the first step in our model is a nucleophilic attack (SN2 type) of the OH group of the Ser residue of the catalytic center of the enzyme on the silicon atom of the silicic acid (Figure 1C,D). This reaction is facilitated by a hydrogen bridge formation between the Ser OH and the imidazole group of the His residue of the catalytic triad amino acids, Ser, His and Asn (Figure 1E). This creates a pentavalent intermediate that is covalently bound to the Ser residue of the enzyme (Figure 1F [left]). The leaving OH group of the substrate, which is bound to the catalytic triad Asn residue via a hydrogen bridge, is then released as a water molecule (Figure 1F, reaction 1). Following the same principle, an OH groups of the covalently bound silicic acid molecule then performs a nucleophilic attack at the silicon of a second silicic acid molecule, followed again by the transfer of a proton and the release of water (Figure 1F, reaction 2). By repeating this step, an enzyme-bound silicic acid trimer is formed, which, after cyclization, is cleaved from the enzyme by formation of a third siloxane bond (Figure 1F, reaction 3). The released reactive cyclic silicic acid trimer then initiates the further condensation reactions with free, soluble silicic acid molecules.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Silicatein is not only able to catalyze the synthesis of inorganic silicon oxides (silica) but also of organosiloxane compounds via trans-etherification reactions, involving the transfer of the silyl group from a silyl ether to the hydroxy group of an alcohol [30]. The kcat/Km values for the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl silyl ethers were found in the range of 2–50 μM−1 min−1 [30].\\n\\nIn addition to the enzymatic mechanism, non-enzymatic processes might contribute to the metal oxide deposition on the silicatein protein. Presumably, both the basic amino acid (Lys and Arg) as well His residues of the silicatein propeptide can interact with the OH groups on the silica surface via hydrogen bridge formation and electrostatic, ionic charge interactions [31]. Such interactions might be involved in the deposition of non-silicon metal oxides mediated by silicatein molecules [32].\\n\\nIn the sponge spicules, the organic silicatein component is built into the inorganic silica material in the form of a central axial filament, which is surrounded by cylindrically arranged silica lamellae, as well as silicatein protein embedded within or between the partially or completely fused silica nanoparticles. The atomic structure of silicatein together with its silica product with a resolution of 2.4 Å has been reported [33].\\n\\n3.2. Silicatein Assembly'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The monomeric silicatein molecules have a strong tendency to oligomerize or polymerize to form long filaments. These filaments can only be disintegrated at high concentrations of chaotropic agents (urea). They are located in the center (axial canal) of the sponge spicules and are visible with light and electron microscopical methods. The self-assembly process of the silicatein can be monitored in dynamic light scattering experiments using the recombinant protein [31]. The recombinant silicatein is a monomer or small oligomer with a hydrodynamic (Stokes) radius of 4 nm at urea concentrations > 2.5 M. At lower urea concentrations, at 2 M urea, aggregates of about 20 silicatein molecules (size 22 nm) are formed. These aggregates grow in length quickly as the urea concentration is further decreased (<2 M).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The basic entity of the silicatein filaments is most likely made up of four silicatein molecules. This tetrameric structure, which silicatein assumes, offers a solution for the following problem. At low substrate concentrations, in the range of the Km value of silicatein (22.7 μM of silicic acid; [21]), which is below the concentration for polycondensation (1 mM), the chemical equilibrium between the silicic acid oligomers formed by silicatein and the monomers should be on the side of the monomeric silicic acid. Therefore, the cyclic trisilicic acid molecules should hydrolyze to the monomers according to the chemical equilibrium. Modeling studies, however, indicate that the catalytic pocket of each of the silicatein monomers, which make up the silicatein tetramer, forms a tunnel-like structure, pointing to the center of the tetramer so that the silicic acid substrate can enter the tunnel from the outer opening and the synthesized cyclic silicic acid trimer can exit into the space within the tetramer. There, the trimers can interact with the hydroxy groups of the Ser clusters [12] of the silicatein molecules that are exposed towards the center of the tetramer. As a result, the oligomeric product of the enzyme reaction, presumably an initially soft and water-rich material, accumulates in the center of the tetramer and is finally pushed out from there through the spaces between the silicatein molecules. The released silica then begins to harden to form a solid, water-insoluble material that envelops the silicatein molecules. As a result, a lattice-like (inorganic) silica matrix is formed, which is complementary to the (organic) silicatein protein lattice, as was observed in X-ray diffraction and electron microscopical studies of the spicules of the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni [34].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The tendency of silicatein to aggregate and precipitate limits its availability for biosynthetic applications. Several methods have been developed to increase the solubility of the protein, for example the preparation of a silicatein fusion protein using a Strep-II tag instead of the histidine [35]. A soluble silicatein fusion protein has also been constructed using a soluble protein tag (ProS2) along with a carbohydrate-binding module that allowed to immobilize the protein on cellulose [36].\\n\\n3.3. Biosynthesis and Processing of Silicatein\\n\\nThe cDNAs/genes that encode for different isoforms of silicatein have been isolated from various sponge species and characterized [23,32]. The sequence analyses revealed that the silicateins are related to the cathepsin family of proteins but differ from this group of proteases in the amino acids that form the catalytic site and are involved in the mechanism of action of these enzymes (see above). Two silicatein isoforms, silicatein-α and silicatein-β, which form an α2β2 tetramer, have been isolated, cloned and characterized from the marine demosponge Suberites domuncula [12].\\n\\nSilicatein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (pre-prosilicatein) molecule, which is processed to the mature silicatein. The maturation of silicatein was demonstrated by expression of a gene, which encodes for a fusion protein of prosilicatein with the bacterial trigger factor chaperone protein. The proteolytic cleavage of the 87-kDa fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli at the thrombin cleavage site within the spacer region into the trigger factor and the 35-kDa prosilicatein led to the immediate autocatalytic cleavage of the prosilicatein into the mature 23-kDa silicatein. This reaction was followed by the self-assembly of the mature silicatein into long insoluble filaments, a process that could be prevented by urea.\\n\\n4. Alkaline Phosphatase and (Poly)Phosphate-Based Materials'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In addition to the silicateins, there is only one other group of enzymes that form an inorganic polymer, the polyP kinases or polyP polymerases, which catalyze the formation of polyP. In contrast to silicatein, these enzymes use an organic compound (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) as the source for the inorganic building blocks (of phosphate) of the inorganic polymer, polyP. The energy-rich bound γ-phosphate of ATP is stepwise incorporated into the growing polyP chain with the formation of a similarly energy-rich acid anhydride bond. Therefore, the equilibrium is not on the side of the product (polyP) and the ΔG0 of the reaction is almost zero.\\n\\nIn contrast to the polyP kinases/polymerases in bacteria and yeasts, there is very little knowledge about the mechanism of polyP synthesis in animals and humans [37]. Both the mitochondria [38,39] and the acidocalcisomes [40] have been implicated in the synthesis of polyP, whereby the acidocalcisomes serve as storage organelles of the polymer [41]. While the mitochondrial polyP synthesis is driven by a gradient/potential on the inner mitochondrial membrane [38], the acidocalcisomal polyP synthesis is probably mediated by a vacuolar transporter chaperone (Vtc) complex, which in yeast is located in the membrane of the acidocalcisomes [40]. On the other hand, with regard to medical application, more detailed insights into the mechanism of polyP degradation have been gained in recent years. At the forefront of polyP degradation is the ALP (Figure 1B).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The ALP is a ubiquitous enzyme found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and has been shown to be the major polyP-degrading enzyme in humans [3,42,43]. This enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylation of a variety of phosphate-containing substrate molecules such as pyrophosphate (PPi), ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), β-glycerophosphate, and pyridoxal-phosphate, as well as synthetic substrates (p-nitrophenylphosphate), but also phosphorylated proteins such as osteopontin [44,45]. In addition, this enzyme can also exhibit phosphotransferase activity, in particular in a coupled chemical reaction [46]; Figure 1B.\\n\\nFigure 1G shows the structure of the ALP monomer with its central β-sheet and flanking α-helices, which are similar between the human enzyme and bacterial (E. coli) enzymes [44].

The negatively charged metaphosphate species (labelled in red in Figure 1H) is bound to the enzyme via the Zn2+ ions and the guanidinium group of an arginine (Arg) residue (Figure 1H,I).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The polyP molecules, the products of polyP polymerases and substrates of ALP, are mainly linear polymers made of up to several hundreds of orthophosphate (Pi) residues, which are linked by energy-rich phosphoanhydride (P-O-P) bonds [3,37,47]. They are found in almost all cells and tissues in humans and also in the blood serum/extracellular space [46,47,48]. The size of the physiological polyP, in human blood, is in the range of 50 to 100 Pi units [48,49]. In addition to the linear polymers, cyclic oligo/polyphosphates exist, at least synthetically, which usually consist of a smaller number, usually 3, 4 or 6, of Pi residues [50]. Branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) have not yet been found in nature, but are available synthetically using phosphoramidite chemistry [51]. Surprisingly, some short-chain ultraphosphates show significant stability in aqueous solution. Recently, evidence has been provided that branched phosphates can also be cleaved enzymatically by ALP, leading to a linearization of the molecules [52].\\n\\nIn humans, the ALP family of proteins comprises four tissue-specific isoforms: tissue-nonspecific ALP, which occurs in bone, liver and kidney, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and intestinal ALP. The tissue-nonspecific ALP, as well as the intestinal ALP, is an ectoenzyme that forms a dimer that is anchored to the outer cell membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor [44,53]. Each catalytic site of the dimer contains two Zn2+ ions and one Mg2+ ion, which are involved in the catalytic mechanism [44]. The GPI anchor is cleaved by specific phospholipases such as the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which leads to the release of the enzyme into the extracellular compartment [54]. Therefore, TNAP is the most common ALP isozyme found in the circulating human plasma [55], in addition to a smaller amount of intestinal ALP [56] and very few placental ALP [57].\\n\\n4.1. Hydrolytic Cleavage of Polyphosphate'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PolyP is hydrolytically cleaved to Pi by ALP using a processive mechanism, i.e., the enzyme remains bound to the substrate (polyP) after each catalytic cycle until the polyP chain is completely degraded [42]. This mechanism is also reflected in the affinity constants (Km values) of the polyP for the enzyme, which decrease with increasing chain length of the polymer, e.g., for the intestinal ALP from 218 µM (PPi) to 27 µM (polyP4), 3.9 µM (polyP18) and 0.5 µM (polyP77); at pH 7.5 [42]. Due to their lower Km (and higher kcat/Km ratios), long-chain polyP molecules are degraded faster than shorter polyP chains, consistent with the processive mode of action of the enzyme. The kcat/Km calculated from the kinetic constants for the intestinal enzyme at pH 7.5, based on Pi, are 2.48 nM−1·s−1 (polyP4), 4.35 nM−1·s−1 (polyP18), and 5.4 nM−1·s−1 (polyP77) [42]. These values are extremely high and are close to the diffusion limit of 1 nM−1·s−1. Such high kcat/Km ratios are typically observed for enzymes showing a processive mechanism, e.g., prolyl 4-hydroylase, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of proline residues in procollagen [58]. For comparison, the kcat/Km ratio for p-nitrophenyl phosphate as an ALP substrate, calculated from the Km (0.4 mM) and kcat (42.55 s−1) of the intestinal ALP [59], is much lower, with 0.11 µM−1·s−1 (at pH 9.5), than the kcat/Km for polyP, e.g., polyP77 with 2.32 nM−1·s−1 (at pH 9.5) [42].\\n\\n4.2.

       " Document(page_content='In addition to the hydrolase activity, which causes the hydrolytic cleavage of polyP or the dephosphorylation of other substrate molecules, evidence has been presented that ALP also has phosphotransferase activity [3], as shown in Figure 1B. The energy-rich phosphate units of the polyP molecules can be transferred to adenine nucleotides (AMP and ADP) if the ALP acts in concert with an adenylate kinase (ADK) [46]. The latter enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of ADP to AMP and ATP. Thereby the chemical energy stored in the phosphoanhydride bonds of polyP is converted into metabolically useful energy. Based on inhibitor experiments, the ALP-catalyzed cleavage of polyP leads to the phosphorylation of AMP to ADP, which is subsequently phosphorylated to ATP via the ADK reaction.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Based on the current knowledge about the mode of action of phosphotransfer reactions catalyzed by ALP, a mechanism for the generation of ADP from polyP by ALP and the generation of ATP by the combined action of ALP and ADK has been proposed [3]. It is likely that a reactive phospho intermediate, a metaphosphate intermediate (Figure 1I), is involved in this reaction, which is bound to the catalytic site of the enzyme (Figure 1G,H) before reacting with the second substrate, with AMP, with formation of ADP (Figure 1B). ADP then serves as substrate for the ADK in the coupled ALP/ADK reaction [3], as shown in Figure 1B. A scheme of the postulated mechanism is shown in Figure 1J. This mechanism (“dissociative mechanism”) of the ALP-catalyzed phosphotransfer reaction, which is characterized by the formation of a transiently existing metaphosphate species (reaction 1; transferred to AMP in reaction 2), differs from the alternative (less likely and energetically less favorable) associative and concerted mechanisms, which involve a pentavalent transition state. The coupling of the ADP formation by ALP with the ADK reaction, which interconverts 2 ADP molecules into AMP and ATP, serving as a substrate in a variety of strongly exergonic phosphotransfer reactions, shifts the equilibrium of the ALP/ADK reactions towards the final ATP product [3]. In this way, the energy stored in polyP is transformed in metabolically useful energy in the form of ATP.'),\n",

This enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylating of phosphocreatine in a futile cycle discovered in adipocytes, which consists of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of creatine [61]. In these cells, this cycle and the ALP are closely associated with the mitochondria, which are also a main organelle in polyP metabolism. Hence, it is possible that polyP is involved in a similar mechanism that dissipates chemical energy as heat. Due to the fact that energy dissipation through thermogenesis counteracts the development of obesity, polyP could have a beneficial effect on metabolic disorders associated with obesity such as diabetes. A regulatory function of the tissue-nonspecific ALP in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production has also been reported for bone and muscle progenitor cells [62].\\n\\n4.3.

It has been suggested that polyP functions as a regulator in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis [63] as well as in the complement system [64]. Physiologically, polyP is released from the blood platelets after activation, especially at injured tissue sites. The platelets contain a high concentration of polyP (~1 mM) [11] due to their high content of acidocalcisomes (dense granules). Moreover, polyP has been shown to be involved mineralization of bone-forming cells and bone formation both in vitro and in vivo [65,66,67]. PolyP acts as a source of phosphate for HA formation [43,68]. It strongly enhances HA deposition of osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells, accompanied by an increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and other proteins involved in osteoblast differentiation and function, such as ALP. Of particular importance for a potential application in tissue regeneration, e.g., wound healing and bone repair, is the ability of polyP to induce cell migration and microvascularization [69].\\n\\n5. Different Forms and Phases of Biosilica and Bioinorganic Polyphosphate\\n\\n5.1. Silica\\n\\nThe primary product of the silicatein reaction consists of soluble silica polymers or a soft, gel-like silica material (Figure 2A) that undergoes an aging/hardening process to become a solid material. In nature, the gel-like consistency of the primary product of silicatein reaction is important, as this property makes the silica product moldable and adaptable, allowing the material to assume, e.g., the specific shape of the sponge spicules.\\n\\nDifferent processes are involved in the maturation of the biosilica material.\\n\\n5.1.1. Gelation'),\n",

In the siliceous sponges, a mucin/nidogen-like protein has been identified, which induces this sol-gel transition, phase separation process [70].\\n\\n5.1.2. Syneresis\\n\\nIn the condensation reaction catalyzed by silicatein, a large amount of water is formed, in addition to the water of the surrounding aqueous solution/reaction mixture, which is entrapped in the silica network. This water is removed by syneresis, a process that is characterized by the expulsion of water and is associated with an increasing crosslinking of the biosilica network (Figure 2B). In parallel, a hardening of the silica material is observed. In living organisms such as sponges, the removal of water proceeds via aquaporin channels. Experimentally, syneresis can be induced by the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [71]. This process leads to a considerable shrinkage of the material [71]. During syneresis, proteins, including silicatein, can become entrapped in the hardened inorganic material, as shown in Figure 3A,B. This gives the material the advantageous properties of an inorganic-organic hybrid material, such as improved mechanical properties, as in the siliceous sponge spicules (Figure 3C).\\n\\n5.1.3. Biosintering\\n\\nFinally, a sintering-like process, termed “biosintering”, is observed (Figure 2C). The incorporated silicatein proteins are assumed to facilitate the fusion of the silica nanospheres, a process that normally requires high temperatures [72]. Obviously, the silicatein molecules arranged on the surface of the nanospheres cause a strong reduction in the activation energy, which enables attachment/neck formation between the 50–200 nm sized spheres at ambient temperatures.\\n\\n5.2. PolyP–PolyP Nano/Microparticles'),\n",

The dissociation constants of the internal and of the first terminal hydroxy groups are pK1 = 2.2, while the second OH at the terminal Pi has a pK2 = 7.2 [73]. The negative charges most likely contribute to the high kinetic stability of polyP in neutral or alkaline solutions [37,74]. Decreasing the pH (increasing the H+ concentration) strongly reduces the activation energy (Ea) for hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoanhydride (P-O-P) bond, allowing the reaction to take place [15,75].\\n\\nIn tissue engineering/repair, polyP can be administered either in soluble form (Figure 2D), e.g., as Na-polyP, or as nano- or microparticles (Figure 2E). Only the amorphous polyP nano/microparticles are morphogenetically active. They are also more biocompatible compared to crystalline phosphate particles, such as the crystalline HA or tricalcium phosphate, which are mostly used in bone tissue engineering and repair. The amorphous polyP nano/microparticles are bioinspired because they mimic the natural polyP deposits in the acidocalcisomes. They can be synthesized from the salts of polyP with various divalent cations [76,77,78]. Based on these particles, various materials for tissue engineering and repair have been developed. The polyP nano/microparticles can be applied either alone, incorporated into (poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres, or embedded in a hydrogel forming polymer network or paste, or in a bio-ink suitable for 3D printing or even 3D cell printing applications.\\n\\n5.2.1.

       " Document(page_content='The Ca-polyP nano/microparticles (usually used in the in the range 80 and 200 nm; see Figure 3D,E) strongly stimulate the activity of bone forming cells. PolyP acts as an inducer of the expression of BMP-2 [65], as well as of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a marker of osteoblastic differentiation. The polymer also potently enhances the expression and activity of ALP, the main enzyme of bone mineralization, in osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells [65]. Moreover, polyP causes an increased expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis [79], without affecting the level of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand) [67]. OPG acts as inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis by sequestering RANKL. As a result RANKL cannot bind to its receptor RANK, which leads to an impaired maturation and function of bone-degrading osteoclasts [67]. The beneficial effect of the amorphous Ca-polyP particles on healing of bone defects was confirmed in animal experiments [80].\\n\\n5.2.2. Magnesium-PolyP'),\n",

Moreover, an upregulation of the expression of aggrecan, ALP and collagen types 2A1 and 3A1 is found [81]. Therefore, these particles are of particular interest for cartilage a tissue, which has only a low repair capacity. This avascular, bradytrophic tissue consists mainly of an extracellular matrix in which only a comparatively few cells are embedded, which makes this tissue, e.g. articular cartilage, susceptible to osteoarthrosis. Based on amorphous Mg-polyP nano/microparticles, new scaffold materials have been developed that resemble natural cartilage in their viscoelastic behavior. These matrices made of polyP and the likewise polyanionic glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid cross-linked via Mg2+ bridges proved to be regeneratively active and supported the infiltration by chondrocytes [81].\\n\\n5.2.3. Strontium-PolyP\\n\\nThe mineralization-inducing activity of amorphous Sr-polyP nano/microparticles was even more pronounced than that of Ca-polyP particles [77]. The Sr-polyP particles also upregulate the expression of ALP, but in contrast to the Ca-polyP particles show only a slight influence on the expression of the SOST gene in osteocytes [77]. Sclerostin, the product of the SOST gene, is a Wnt antagonist that inhibits the differentiation and mineralization of bone cells via the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [82]. Consequently, the amorphous Sr-polyP particles show a stronger effect on osteogenesis than the Ca-polyP particles. The results of in vitro experiments were confirmed in animal studies using the rat critical-size calvarial defect model; already after an implantation period of 12 weeks, almost complete restoration of the bone defect was found [77].\\n\\n5.2.4.

The polyP component was integrated through ionic (Zn2+) cross-linking to alginate and periodate-oxidized alginate, bound to gelatin via Schiff base formation.

These particles are composed so-called Posner’s clusters [Ca9(PO4)6], with a size of 0.7–1 nm and a Ca/P ratio of 1.5 [85], which assemble to 30–100 nm large aggregates that are finally transformed into the crystalline HA [(Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2; Ca/P ratio, 1.67] [86]. PolyP retards the transformation of the particles into the Ca-phosphate/HA crystals. For the stabilization of the amorphous particles, a polyP content of ≥10% polyP is required [84]. Particles prepared by co-precipitation of calcium and phosphate in the presence of lower concentrations of polyP are crystalline. The polyP-stabilized ACP shows strong osteoblastic and vasculogenic properties. In vitro experiments revealed that the particles markedly enhance the expression of ALP and collagen type 1, as well as mineralization in SaOS-2 cells. In vivo, in the calvarial bone defect model of rabbits, the polyP-stabilized ACP encapsulated in PLGA microspheres exhibited a pronounced osteoinductive activity, already after a six-week healing period, which was clearly superior compared to crystalline Ca-phosphate and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) used as a control [84].

This coacervate phase of polyP (Figure 2F and Figure 3F) shows the characteristic morphogenetic activity of the polymer and is more biocompatible, but less stable/more rapidly degradable than the nano/microparticles, which are characterized by high stability due to their negative zeta potential, which prevents the particle aggregation [87]. A polyP coacervate is also obtained after addition of metal ions to soluble polyP at neutral pH and an approximately stoichiometric phosphate:metal ion ratio, while the amorphous polyP nanoparticles are formed from polyP under alkaline conditions in the presence of an excess of these ions [87]. The coacervate formation proceeds via a phase separation of a more viscous liquid phase, which contain the fraction of the longer polyP molecules, and a less viscous liquid phase with the fraction of the shorter polyP molecules [88,89]. The adaptable matrix thus formed offers optimal conditions for the ingrowth and embedding of cells and their differentiation/proliferation [87].\\n\\n6. Properties of Amorphous Silica and PolyP as Regeneratively Active Inorganic Polymers\\n\\n6.1. Morphogenetic Activity'),\n",

This property makes these materials particularly interesting for regenerative medicine. Both materials have the ability to induce the differentiation of stem cells by activating the expression of specific genes [10,67,90]. Biosilica has not only osteoconductive, but also osteoinductive activity [10]. It is able to induce the mineralization/HA formation of bone-forming cells such as human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells; it is also biocompatible and biodegradable [67]. In addition, biosilica is capable of increasing the expression ratio of OPG and RANKL [67]. A decrease in this expression ratio is causatively involved in the pathogenic mechanism of osteoporosis. It should be noted biosilica from diatoms has also been shown to exhibit pronounced osteogenic activity [91,92].\\n\\nIn addition to this morphogenetic activity, the release of monomeric orthosilicate from the amorphous polymeric silica could contribute to the stimulatory effect of silica on bone mineralization. The nucleation of HA is promoted at lower silicate concentrations, in the range 0.05–0.5 mM [93]. Moreover, it could be shown that ACC, the precursor of the likewise amorphous ACP and crystalline HA, is stabilized by silicate, which prevents crystallization of the amorphous mineral [94]. Based on modeling studies, it has also been reported that cyclic silicic acid trimeric motifs on the silica surface mimic the apatite nucleation site on bone sialoprotein (BSP) [95,96]. This Ca2+ binding site on the BSP surface consists of three (modified) acidic amino acids (phosphoserine and two glutamic acids [97]), which stereochemically fit to the silanol (SiOH) groups of the silicic acid trimer on the silica surface.'),\n",

The direction of the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be steered either in the osteogenic or in the chondrogenic direction. Ca- and Sr-polyP nano/microparticles preferentially induce the regeneration of mineralized bone tissue [11,46,76,98]. Mg-polyP nano/microparticles, on the other hand, preferentially promote the regeneration of cartilage [81]. Such a differential gene expression is exceptional and makes the polyP-based nano/microparticles or coacervates, as well as scaffolds/hydrogels containing them, excellent materials for the regeneration/repair of bone and cartilage defects, but also for other applications such as wound healing [99]. The addition of cytokines/growth factors, as is the case with many other materials for tissue regeneration/repair, is not required [77,98].\\n\\n6.2. Generation of Metabolic Energy\\n\\nA unique property of polyP, in addition to its morphogenetic activity and not shown by silica, is its ability to generate metabolically useful energy. Similarly to glycogen as an organic energy storage, the inorganic polyP acts as a storage for metabolically available energy, but with two major differences. Firstly, polyP in particulate form needs much less space to store the same amount of energy as glycogen, and secondly it can be used directly to generate ATP via the ALP-ADK coupling, while ATP production from glycogen requires a series of multistep metabolic pathways (glycolysis, citric acid cycle and respiratory chain/F1F0-ATP synthase). No other polymer is able to store as much energy in such a small space as polyP. In particular, polyP acts as a donor of metabolic energy not only within the cell, but also extracellularly, in the extracellular matrix, which does not have any mitochondria as the main energy producers in human/animal organisms [46,100].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG0) for the hydrolysis of P-O-P bond in the linear polyP is about −30.5 kJ·mol−1, similar to the ΔG0 for the hydrolysis of the α-β and β-γ phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP. Therefore, a large amount of energy can be released by complete hydrolysis of a polyP chain, e.g., in the case of polyP with the physiological chain length of about 40 Pi residues (polyPn with n = 40, containing 39 P-O-P linkages), about 1189.5 kJ·mol−1 (=39 × −30.5 kJ·mol−1; Figure 4A). Since the cyclic triphosphate contains one more energy-rich bond than the linear triphosphate, complete hydrolysis of the cyclic molecule results in a 1.5-fold higher ΔG0 (−91.5 kJ·mol−1) than the linear polyP3 (−61 kJ·mol−1; Figure 4B). This energy released during the hydrolytic ring opening of cyclotriphosphate can be used for phosphorylation reactions in synthetic chemistry [101,102].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='It is well established that tissue repair is a highly energy-consuming process and, in particular, tissues with only a few cells, such as cartilage, cannot cover their energy demand through mitochondrial ATP production. The second enzyme involved in ATP generation, ADK, is not only found intracellularly, but is also associated with the plasma membrane, similarly to ALP, where it could work in a coupled manner with ALP to produce ATP in the extracellular space (Figure 1B). This is important because many processes that take place in the extracellular matrix (ECM) consume energy, not only during tissue repair, but also during tissue remodeling, such as in human bone [103,104]. This energy, in the form of ATP or ADP, is needed for the synthesis and assembly of the macromolecules that build up the ECM (collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans), but also for the activity of extracellular kinases [105,106] and extracellular chaperone(-like) proteins [46,107]. The functional significance of polyP as a donor for metabolic energy in the form of ATP can be demonstrated in inhibitor experiments. It has been shown that the increase in ATP level in the cell supernatants after exposure of cell cultures to polyP is suppressed by adding the ALP inhibitor levamisole. The administration of the ADK inhibitor P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′) pentaphosphate (AP5A) causes a drop of the extracellular ATP/ADP ratio, i.e., an increase in ADP, the product of the ALP reaction [46].\\n\\nIt has not yet known whether ALP can also split and liberate the energy present in cyclic trimetaphosphate in addition to the linear molecules in human cells, like the enzyme from E. coli [108].

The first polyP-containing 3D-printable bio-ink was developed by embedding amorphous Ca-polyP particles into a poly(ϵ-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix. The tissue-like scaffolds fabricated with this bio-ink supported the ingrowth of SaOS-2 cells; the stimulatory effect on cell migration was paralleled with an increased expression of the cell attracting chemokine SDF-1α (stromal cell-derived factor-1α) [110]. Another bio-ink was based on Na-polyP, gelatin and alginate, complexed with Ca2+ ions. SaOS-2 cells embedded in this ink remain alive and proliferatively active after printing [111]. Recently, a bio-ink based on N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan/alginate/gelatin was developed, which was enriched with both soluble polyP (Na-polyP) and Ca-polyP nanoparticles (acting as a depot form); this bio-ink enabled the successful 3D bio-printing of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (Figure 5G).

First, a PCL solution supplemented with TEOS was used for electrospinning. Subsequently, the electrospun nanofiber network was incubated with silicatein. The biosilica cover on the electrospun fiber mats formed by the silicatein reaction was found to be morphogenetically active. It supported the growth and mineralization of SaOS-2 cells in vitro [113]. Another approach exploited the synergistic effect of amorphous Ca-polyP nanoparticles and retinol on cell growth compared to either of the components alone. Electrospun fiber mats consisting of poly(d,l-lactide) (PLA) were developed, which contained Ca-polyP nanoparticles with incorporated retinol (Figure 5H) [114]. MC3T3-E1 cells grown onto these mats showed increased expression of the genes encoding for leptin and the leptin receptor, as well as for fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4).

An emulsion-based technique was also used to embed Ca-polyP nano/microparticles or Na-polyP [116] (Figure 5I) and polyP-stabilized ACC [80] in PLGA. The encapsulation has the advantage that it protects the polyP against hydrolytic attack by the ubiquitous ALP. After implanting the nano/microparticle-containing spheres into cranial defects of rats, the particles were disintegrated within 4 weeks. In parallel, cells were seen to invade the space initially occupied by the particles, which synthesized new bone mineral.

An increased expression of BMP-2 and OPG, but not of RANKL, was also observed in SaOS-2 cells grown onto 3D printed scaffolds that had been biologized by impregnation with silica. Furthermore, it was found that the functionalization of a chitosan-graft-polycaprolactone matrix with biosilica by surface immobilization of silicatein confers osteogenic activity towards SaOS-2 cells, which resulted in increased cell viability, ALP activity and mineralization [117]. Moreover, the co-incubation of beads containing osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells with beads containing osteoclast-like RAW 264.7 led to an enhanced expression of the gene encoding for OPG in SaOS-2 cells when the beads were based on a silica-containing Na-alginate hydrogel matrix.

With this approach, it has been possible for us, in recent years, to develop materials with adapted hardness and viscoelastic properties for potential application in bone and cartilage repair. Some materials turned out to be applicable in 3D printing/bio-printing procedures. Organic polymeric materials used with polyP included negatively charged polysaccharides such as N,O-carboxymethylchitosan (a carboxymethylated chitosan, a polysaccharide composed of β-(1→4)-linked d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine), alginate (composed of α-d-mannuronic acid and β-l-guluronic acid), hyaluronic acid (d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine), chondroitin sulfate (a sulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid), and karaya gum (a polysaccharide consisting galactose, rhamnose and galacturonic acid), as well as collagen and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The addition of calcium ions to a hydrogel matrix formed by polyP and the likewise polyanionic N,O-carboxymethylchitosan and alginate resulted in the formation of organized bundles of the polymers and the hardening of the material by crosslinking Ca2+ bridges [98]. A material with viscoelastic properties similar to cartilage was prepared by cross-linking polyP and hyaluronic acid via Mg2+ bridges [81]. Using a freeze-extraction technique, a macroporous scaffold was obtained from polyP, chondroitin sulfate and collagen. Addition of Ca2+ ions to the matrix resulted not only in Ca2+ crosslinks but also in the in situ formation of Ca-polyP nanoparticles, which were lined up on the collagen fibers [118]. In situ generation of Ca-polyP nanoparticles was also observed in a cryogel fabricated from polyP, karaya gum and PVA [119]. This matrix was obtained by Ca2+-mediated ionic gelation of the karaya gum and intermolecular cross-linking of PVA by freeze-thawing. After exposure to medium/serum the Ca-polyP nanoparticles within the cryogel were transformed into the biologically active coacervate, which supported cell invasion and cell growth of human MSC into the porous scaffold [119]. The prepared porous polyP/karaya gum/PVA cryogel had viscoelastic properties similar to cartilage and muscle [120,121].

The first steps towards translation into the clinic are currently going on.\\n\\nVery promising results have recently been achieved in patients with chronic wounds. Wound healing, including healing of chronic wounds (wounds that do not heal within 3 months) such as diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers and pressure sores, is an energy (ATP) consuming process [122]. This energy demand can be covered by the energy delivering polyP. Animal experiments with normal mice and diabetic mice with delayed wound healing revealed that wound healing is significantly accelerated by topical administration of amorphous polyP nano/microparticles [99]. In order to apply polyP for treatment of chronic wounds in patients, we applied a newly developed technique based on the integration of the polyP microparticles into mechanically compressed collagen mats [78]. Both amorphous Zn-polyP particles [78] and amorphous Ca-polyP particles [123] were used. It was found that the incorporated polyP particles are transformed into the coacervate, the biologically active and biodegradable form of the polymer, after exposure to protein-containing body fluids/wound secretions. The treatment of chronic wounds in all patients examined so far with the collagen mats supplemented with Ca-polyP microparticles resulted in a strongly accelerated re-epithelialization rate and a complete healing of the wound within up to 9 weeks. In order to achieve a retard effect, soluble, immediately available water-soluble Na-polyP was administered together with the polyP microparticles with delayed activation.'),\n",

Such a material should offer the cells an optimal microenvironment in order to differentiate and proliferate in a spatially and temporally controlled manner [124]. It is expected that these materials support the different phases of repair, including the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells and their differentiation into the osteoblast lineage, as well as angiogenesis, extracellular matrix synthesis, and mineralization. Physiologically, polyP and the growth factors required to induce these processes are released from the platelets, which are involved in the formation of the hematoma after bone injury [125]. As a component of a scaffold material, polyP has the ability to induce the necessary growth factors. In addition to factors that promote osteoblast differentiation such as BMP-2 or mineralization such as ALP, the factors induced by polyP also include VEGF, which supports angiogenesis. In addition to the metabolic energy delivered by the energy-rich polyP itself, the vascularization of the developing bone tissue is essential for a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients.\\n\\nThe first clinical studies on the use of polyP in human bone repair have started [126].

(A) Silicatein exhibits both a hydrolase activity (hydrolytic cleavage of Si-O-C bonds, e.g., of tetraalkoxysilane compounds), and silica polymerase activity, mediating the formation of polymeric biosilica from natural monomeric silicic acid precursors. (B) ALP can act both as a hydrolase, which degrades polyphosphate (polyP) to monomeric orthophosphate forming calcium phosphate deposits, and as a transferase that transfers a metaphosphate intermediate formed by cleavage of the polymer to AMP. The ADP formed is then used as a substrate by adenylate kinase (ADK). (C–F) Reactions proceeding at the catalytic site of silicatein and (G–J) of ALP; the reactions numbered are described in the text. (C) Computer model of silicatein showing the catalytic triad amino acids His, Ser and Asn (in red). The propeptide sequence of the immature silicatein is given in green. (D,E) Proposed mechanism of biosilica formation. The reaction starts by nucleophilic attack of the OH group of a Ser residue at the silicic acid monomer, facilitated by a hydrogen bridge formation to the His imidazole group. (F) Subsequent steps of the proposed silicatein mechanism, leading to the formation of a reactive cyclic trisilicic acid species. (G–I) Involvement of the zinc ions bound to the His imidazole rings of the catalytic center of ALP (G,H) in binding of the metaphosphate intermediate (I) during the enzymatic reaction. (J) Transfer reaction of the enzyme-bound metaphosphate species to AMP catalyzed by ALP.'),\n",

The cyclic polyP3 has one phosphoanhydride bond more than the linear molecule and can deliver 50% more energy (ΔG0 = −90 kJ·mol−1) compared to linear polyP3 (ΔG0 = −60 kJ·mol−1).'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an infrequent condition of childhood, and is extremely rare in infants, with only 26 cases described. The etiology is still unknown. Typical clinical manifestations change with age, and symptoms are atypical in infants, thus the diagnosis could be late. This is based on increased opening pressure at lumbar puncture, papilloedema and normal cerebral MRI. The measurement of cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure in infants is an issue because many factors may affect it, and data about normal values are scanty. The mainstay of treatment is acetazolamide, which allows to relieve symptoms and to avoid permanent visual loss if promptly administered.\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nWe report the case of an 8-month-old infant admitted because of vomit, loss of appetite and irritability; later, also bulging anterior fontanel was observed. Cerebral MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis resulted negative and after two lumbar punctures he experienced initial symptom relief. Once the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was made, he received oral acetazolamide, and corticosteroids, with progressive symptom resolution.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nInfantile idiopathic intracranial hypertension is extremely rare, and not well described yet. Bulging anterior fontanel in otherwise healthy infants with normal neuroimaging should be always considered suggestive, but can be a late sign, while irritability and anorexia, especially if associated with vomiting, may represent an early sign. In such cases, lumbar puncture should be always done, hopefully with cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure measurement, which is among coded diagnostic criteria, but whose threshold is controversial in infants. Early diagnosis, timely treatment and strict follow-up help to prevent vision loss or death of affected infants.\\n\\nKeywords'),\n",

It is infrequent in childhood, and extremely rare in infancy [1–5]. We describe the case of an 8-month-old male affected by IIH, followed by a brief review of the literature.\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nA previously healthy 8-month-old infant with uneventful personal history and regular psychomotor development was admitted to the Emergency Department because of non biliary vomiting, irritability and lethargy; 4\\u2009days before, he had fallen from the bed without any apparent acute complications; no visit was done in that occasion.\\n\\nOn the physical examination at the arrival, he was fussy, with inconsolable crying, but no neurological sign was observed. Anterior fontanel was normal. Laboratory tests included blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, liver and renal function tests, and urine analysis, all proving negative. Intussusception was excluded on abdominal ultrasound. Head ultrasound showed mild frontal subarachnoidal enlargement, up to 5\\u2009mm.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Soon after the admission, he got worse, with bulging anterior fontanel and anorexia. Head computed tomography (CT) scan proved negative for intracranial lesions, and the electroencephalogram was normal. Then the infant underwent lumbar puncture (LP) on sedation. LP was performed in the lateral recumbent\\xa0 position, with legs flexed. After the infant’s back was cleaned with antiseptic solution, 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted at the 4th lumbar space. In this case we had not the possibility to measure CSF opening pressure, anyway we used an empiric method already described in literature [6, 7], and we observed that in 10\\u2009s the number of CSF drops flowing through the needle was higher compared to the number observed during routine procedure. After the needle was removed, the area was cleaned and a compressive medication on the needle site was performed. The infant was put on i.v. ceftriaxone and acyclovir after the CSF sample collection, then CSF analysis revealed slightly increased protein level (74,6\\u2009mg/dl, normal value 20–45\\u2009mg/dl) and leucocyte level (6 cells/mmc), with normal glucose level and negative Gram stains and cultures, as well as negative HSV, EBV, CMV, Enteroviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction. Immediately after LP, the infant’s condition improved significantly, and he could be fed properly.\\n\\nThe ophthalmology evaluation revealed pale and elevated optic disc with retinal venous congestion.\\n\\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium showed mild narrowing of the pituitary gland peduncle and flattening of the sella turcica. The CSF flow study was normal and venography study did not show any venous thrombosis. Under suspicion of IIH, complete blood metabolic, endocrinological, and infective workout proved negative.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Five days after the LP, the patient presented again irritability and anorexia; head circumference increased from 46.5\\u2009cm to 47.7\\u2009cm. The patient was then transferred to the regional Pediatric Hospital for neurosurgery evaluation and further investigation and therapy. His neurologic status and physical examination were normal except for full, tense and pulsing anterior fontanel measuring 3\\u2009×\\u20093\\u2009cm. A new ophthalmology evaluation confirmed papilloedema, and another LP was done using the same method: again, opening lumbar pressure was increased, and CSF analysis was normal. West Nile Virus polymerase chain reaction was also negative. Neurosurgery evaluation did not suggest any other intervention.\\n\\nIIH was then diagnosed on Friedman criteria (Table\\xa01) [8] and the infant was put on acetazolamide (10\\u2009mg/kg/day) and i.v. dexamethasone (0.2\\u2009mg/kg/day). After the second LP and the beginning of medical therapy, he rapidly got better, anterior fontanel flattened, and vital signs remained normal during all the admission.

PTCS can be primary (also known as IIH), if no cause is identified, or secondary, if a specific cause is recognized (i.e. drugs administration, abnormalities of the cerebral venous system, or predisposing systemic diseases).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Though PTCS can affect both children and adults, there are significant differences regarding the clinical spectrum, risk factors and epidemiology. In children, the incidence is 0.6–0.9/100,000/year [10], and it is very rare in infancy. To our knowledge, only 26 infants have been described so far; among them only 6 met all the diagnostic criteria [1–5]. In order to find literature on already described cases of infantile PTCS, we searched Pubmed from inception to February 2021; age limit was 0–23\\u2009months and we used the following terms combined with boolean operators AND and OR: idiopathic intracranial hypertension, infantile idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, infants. Out of 354 articles, 143 were case reports, reviews and systematic reviews; finally, 17 papers describing 26 infants were included in our brief review.\\n\\nIIH is the most common kind of PTCS both in children and adults [11]. Though female gender, obesity, and polycystic ovary represent risk factors for IIH in pubertal children, this is not shown in younger ones, particularly in infants [12]. Among the 26 infants with IIH described in literature, a couple of twins were affected by cystic fibrosis and Vitamin A deficiency, one had isolated Vitamin A deficiency, four had Vitamin D deficiency, two had positive serum human herpesvirus-6 testing, two had hypophosphatasia, and four had a history of topical hydrocortisone treatment some days before the onset of symptoms. In our case, elevated serum Vitamin A level was found.\\n\\nThe clinical manifestations of IIH vary with age. Headache is a key symptom, described as progressive frontal pain worsening with Valsalva maneuver and postural changes, but it is reported only by 36.6% of pediatric patients [13]. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, tinnitus, visual impairment and diplopia secondary to VI cranial nerve palsy [14].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Younger children may show nonspecific symptoms like irritability, hyporeactivity, anorexia, sleep disruption, head tilting, and less often papilledema. Infants may present a bulging fontanel and irritability as the most commonly reported initial symptoms, as well as vomiting [1–5]. Another unequivocal sign of intracranial hypertension is papilloedema, however it was reported only in 9 of the 26 infants described in literature.\\n\\nDiagnostic criteria were firstly formulated by Dandy in 1937 [15], then Smith re-proposed them in 1985 [16], as follows: 1) signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, 2) localized neurological signs (except paralysis of the VI pair of cranial nerves), 3) CSF opening pressure\\u2009>\\u200925 cmH20, with normal examination, 4) negative head CT scan.\\n\\nA new revision was published in 2013 (Table\\xa01): the new criteria are more restrictive and differentiate the diagnosis into confirmed IIH (papilloedema and increased CSF pressure), probable IIH (papilloedema and normal CSF pressure), and IIH without papilloedema (only increased pressure with VI cranial nerve palsy) [8]. Therefore, ophthalmological evaluation of fundus oculi, LP and neuroimaging are required to make a diagnosis. The ophthalmological evaluation aims to identify papilloedema and should be performed by a pediatric specialist. Typically, the optic disc is pale and oedematous, with surrounding tortuous and dilated retinal vessels [17].\\n\\nMRI of the brain is necessary to exclude any lesion that could produce intracranial hypertension, and should include contrast medium infusion and angiographic study [8]. Moreover, characteristic radiological signs are: sella turcica with narrowed pituitary peduncle, as observed in our infant, and crushing of the posterior pole of the eye [8].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The LP, which is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure itself, must be performed whenever intracranial hypertension is suspected, after excluding possible contraindications. Not only the opening pressure, but also CSF analysis is important for diagnostic purposes. In our infant, no abnormal CSF values were found, except for proteins slightly higher than normal.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Even if the measurement of CSF opening pressure could be an important additional diagnostic factor, actually it is not routinely performed [18]. In our case, the neurosurgeon described the opening pressure as increased on both occasions by counting the number of CSF drops flowing through the spinal needle in a specified period, as already described [6, 7], however we do not know the precise pressure measurement. In published studies on PTCS, CSF opening pressure was not documented for all the patients, because other factors documented indirectly elevated CSF pressure (symptoms, imaging data) [8, 19]. Our infant presented with papilloedema and bulging anterior fontanel, which represent indirect signs of high CSF pressure. Indeed, data about CSF opening pressure in childhood are scanty and come mainly from patients ageing 1–18\\u2009years [20, 21], but to our knowledge no clear threshold has been established in infants <\\u20091\\u2009year, in which the open fontanel and sutures might influence the measure. Moreover, other factors may affect the opening pressure value: in particular sedation-related hypercapnia may raise it, as well as crying in not sedated children [8, 20]. For these reasons, a cut-off of 28 cmH2O could be useful more for research than for clinical purpose [20]. In his article, Ellis concluded that the normal range for CSF opening pressure measured in a flexed lateral decubitus position in children is 10 to 28\\u2009cm H2O [6]. However, Avery et al. presented a case to describe the inaccuracy of CSF opening pressure measures by LP: they concluded that a single CSF opening pressure value should not be considered as the only determinant of elevated intracranial pressure [20]. On the other hand, low opening pressure should not exclude the diagnosis of PTCS if typical symptoms and papilloedema are reported [8].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Principles of therapy in children are based on guidelines for adult, aiming mainly to prevent permanent loss of vision and relieve from symptoms (above all irritability in infants, and headache in older children). The therapeutic cornerstone is acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces the production of CSF; in a recent study, acetazolamide was effective in 76% of children with IIH [21]. The recommended starting dose is 10–20\\u2009mg/kg/day, which can be progressively increased up to 100\\u2009mg/kg or 2\\u2009g per day. Side effects are mild metabolic acidosis, fatigue, dysgeusia and paraesthesia. In case of failure or contraindications to give acetazolamide, topiramate can be used, thanks to its weak inhibitory action on carbonic anhydrase [22].\\n\\nI.v. corticosteroids could be prescribed in association with acetazolamide, in case of severe visual impairment at the onset. However, currently acetazolamide alone is preferred also in this case, due to fewer side effects [23]. In our case, the corticosteroid was administered for anti-oedema purposes in association with acetazolamide, in consideration of poor general conditions and marked irritability.\\n\\nThe optimal duration of therapy is not well defined, but it should be continued until complete resolution of the papilloedema. A recent review of pediatric cases shows that the course of the disease is highly variable, usually showing remission after more than 7\\u2009months [1]. In our case, the infant was treated for 2\\u2009months with acetazolamide, with complete resolution of papilloedema and of symptoms 3\\u2009months after discharge.\\n\\nIn case of rapid worsening of visual function despite adequate medical therapy, neurosurgical interventions may be needed, such as fenestration of the optic nerve, or lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt [24].\\n\\nThe main complication of untreated IIH is permanent vision loss (up to 20% of children), so prompt therapy and strict pediatric and ophthalmological follow-up is required [25].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Negative prognostic factors are visual impairment and severe papilloedema already at the onset. Finally, the risk of recurrence is estimated at 18–20% and is more frequent in the first 18\\u2009months after diagnosis [26].\\n\\nIn conclusion, infantile IIH is an extremely rare disease, not yet well described in literature. Of course, affected infants cannot describe typical symptoms such as visual impairment, diplopia, tinnitus, headache and nausea, and this makes the diagnosis difficult and often late. Bulging anterior fontanel in otherwise healthy infants with normal neuroimaging should be always considered suggestive of IIH, but can be a late sign. In accordance with literature, our case shows how irritability and anorexia, especially if associated with vomiting [1], may represent an early sign of intracranial hypertension in infancy. In such cases, LP should be always done, hopefully with CSF opening pressure measurement, which is among coded diagnostic criteria, but whose threshold is controversial in infants. Early diagnosis, timely start of acetazolamide and strict pediatric and ophthalmological follow-up help in reducing the risk of relapse and safeguard the patient’s visual acuity.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nIIH Idiopathic intracranial hypertension\\n\\nCSF Cerebrospinal fluid\\n\\nLP Lumbar puncture\\n\\nCT Computed tomography\\n\\nMRI Magnetic resonance imaging\\n\\nPTCS Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe want to thank the Ophthalmologists - Dr. Gabriella D’Alonzo, Dr. Paola Cannizzo, and Dr. Miriam Brandozzi of the Regina Margherita Children’s Hospital of Turin - and the Pediatric Neurologists - Dr. Fabiana Vercellino of the Child Neurology and Psychiatry Unit, Children’s Hospital AO SS Antonio e Biagio e C.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nIntroduction\\nShort rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS) is a rare inherited, autosomal recessive, lethal skeletal dysplasia that can be diagnosed by prenatal USG. It is characterized by micromelia, short ribs, hypoplastic thorax, polydactyly (pre- and postaxial), and multiple anomalies of major organs. There are four types.[1] Here we report a case of SRPS type 2 (Majewski syndrome).\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 23-year-old woman, who had a second-degree consanguineous marriage, was referred for routine obstetric USG during her last trimester. She was a second gravida with one living child; her previous child was normal. USG revealed a single live intrauterine fetus of 28 weeks gestation (as assessed by biparietal diameter and head circumference); there was also mild polyhydramnios. The fetal thorax was extremely narrow [Figure 1]. Thoracic to abdominal circumference ratio was 0.76 (normal range: 0.77–1.01). USG of the fetal abdomen revealed bilateral enlarged (36 mm) echogenic kidneys and minimal ascites [Figure 2]. The fetal face was hydropic, with indentation of the upper lip. The upper limb bones were micromelic (18-19 weeks gestation) and there was polydactyly [Figure 3]. The lower limb bones were micromelic (19–19.5 weeks), with unusually short tibiae [Figure 4]. The left foot showed hallux varus deformity. Bilateral club feet with polydactyly was also noted. There were no neural tube defects, and the fetal stomach and urinary bladder were normal. Fetal echocardiography revealed no abnormality. The umbilical cord showed a Wharton jelly cyst.\\n\\nFigure 1 Sagittal USG through the fetal thorax and abdomen shows a narrow thorax (arrows). P, posterior; A, anterior\\n\\nFigure 2 Coronal USG of the fetal kidneys shows bilateral echogenic enlarged kidneys (arrows)\\n\\nFigure 3 Transverse USG through the hand shows polydactyly\\n\\nFigure 4 Oblique coronal USG of the left leg shows a short fibula (arrowhead) and an extremely short tibia (arrow)'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Based on these findings, we arrived at a diagnosis of a lethal skeletal dysplasia, i.e., SRPS type 2. Since this is a lethal disorder, we advised elective termination of the pregnancy followed by fetal autopsy and genetic counseling.\\n\\nLabor was induced and the patient was delivered a female stillborn baby vaginally. The birth weight was 650 g. Infantogram of the stillborn baby [Figure 5] revealed 11 pairs of ribs that were short and horizontally located, a narrow thorax, short upper limb bones, normal iliac bones, short lower limb bones (femur and fibula), extremely short ovoid tibiae, and rounded metaphyseal ends of long bones.\\n\\nFigure 5 Infantogram after birth shows short and horizontally located 11 pairs of ribs, with a narrow thorax and short upper and lower limb long tubular bones. The metaphyseal ends of the long bones (arrow) are rounded and there are extremely short ovoid tibiae (arrowhead)\\n\\nThe gross autopsy findings [Figure 6], such as the bell-shaped thorax, micromelia, pre- and postaxial polysyndactyly, and the clefting of upper lip, along with the histopathological findings [Figure 7] of hypoplastic lungs, hepatic fibrosis with bile duct proliferation, medullary sponge kidneys, and markedly retarded growth zone of femur, supported our prenatal USG diagnosis of SRPS type 2.\\n\\nFigure 6 Postnatal photograph of the fetus shows a hydropic face, indentation of the upper lip, broad and flattened nose, depressed nasal bridge, micrognathia, narrow thorax, protuberant abdomen, and Wharton jelly umbilical cord cyst.

There is a 25% risk of recurrence in further pregnancies. Traditionally, four major types are recognized: type 1 (Saldino-Noonan), type 2 (Majewski), type 3 (Verma-Naumoff), and type 4 (Beemar-Langer). These conditions are classified within the family of short rib dysplasias with or without polydactyly, a group which includes asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (Jeune syndrome), and chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis-van Creveld dysplasia). SRPS types 1 through 4 are lethal in the newborn period because of the severe pulmonary hypoplasia and the other associated anomalies.[1] On the other hand, the Ellis-van Creveld and Jeune syndromes are not uniformly lethal. Accurate prenatal diagnosis is important in order to provide adequate counseling.[1] SRPS shows female predominance.[2]\\n\\nType 2 SRPS (Majewski syndrome) was first described in 1971.[3] The exact incidence is not known but, till 1994, about 33 cases have been reported.[4] The molecular basis of SRPS has not been elucidated. Urioste recognized a balanced pericentric inversion of chromosome 4 in a proband with clinical and radiological manifestations of SRPS and proposed that the disorder could be due to disruption of the gene 4p16 region.[5] Additional chromosomal material may be seen at 17p11 on high-resolution prometaphase analysis.[4]'),\n",

Death occurs in the perinatal period.[4]\\n\\nThe radiological manifestations include (a) underdeveloped mandible, with irregular teeth; (b) extremely short and horizontally located ribs; (c) limb abnormalities such as mesomelia, with marked shortening of tubular bones (the tibiae are particularly extremely short and have an ovoid configuration), rounded metaphyseal ends of long tubular bones, precocious ossification of proximal femoral epiphysis, polydactyly, distal phalangeal hypoplasia, and symphalangism; and (d) almost normal pelvis.[4]\\n\\nPrenatal diagnosis by USG is based on the findings of short long bones, very short ribs (narrow thorax), normal vertebrae, polydactyly, hyperextension of head and neck, and large echogenic kidneys.[4] Other anomalies that may be detected by USG include congenital heart disease, median cleft lip, and anophthalmia.[7] On pathological examination, the physis is markedly retarded and disorganized.[8]'),\n",

However, postaxial polydactyly is present only in SRPS, while hypomineralization is only rarely present in some subtypes of SRPS. Another condition to be distinguished from SRPS is chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis-van Creveld syndrome), which too has features of thoracic hypoplasia and postaxial polydactyly; however, in the latter disorder, the thoracic hypoplasia is less pronounced and the limbs are less affected. The occurrence of a median cleft lip identifies type 2 and type 4 SRPS.[7] However, short ovoid tibia are not seen in type 4 SRPS; this is the diagnostic finding of type 2 SRPS (Majewski).[9] The other differential diagnosis are shown in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1 Disorders with thoracic dysplasia and polydactyly[1],[10]'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmcIntroduction\\n\\nHypercalcaemia in the neonate and infant, although uncommon, can have serious long-term consequences, including nephrocalcinosis that may cause permanent kidney damage, osteoporosis and neurodevelopmental impairments, and has varied etiologies (Table 1). Hypercalcaemia is defined as a serum calcium concentration two standard deviations greater than the normal mean. An accurate determination of the serum calcium concentration with age-appropriate normal ranges (Table 2) is required as serum calcium levels are higher in newborns and preterm infants and decline with age [1, 3]. In late gestation, calcium is actively transported across the placenta to facilitate mineralisation of the foetal skeleton, resulting in relative foetal hypercalcaemia. At birth, a transient decrease in serum calcium occurs as active placental transport ends upon cutting the umbilical cord [4]. This transient hypocalcaemia is more pronounced in preterm infants, due to the early discontinuation of transplacental calcium transport and reduced responses to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and infants of diabetic mothers, caused by neonatal functional hypoparathyroidism due to maternal hypomagnesemia [5]. Hypercalcaemia presents clinically with a range of symptoms including failure to thrive, poor feeding, constipation, polyuria, irritability, lethargy, seizures and hypotonia. When hypercalcaemia is suspected, an accurate diagnosis will require an evaluation of potential causes (e.g. family history or diet) and assessment for physical features (such as dysmorphology, granulomatous disease or subcutaneous fat deposits), as well as biochemical measurements. These measurements should include total and ionised serum calcium, serum albumin to calculate corrected serum calcium, serum phosphate, creatinine, intact PTH, vitamin D metabolites and urinary calcium, phosphate and creatinine [6].

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nSerum calcium levels are maintained by interplay between the parathyroid glands, kidney, gut and bone (Fig. 1). When serum calcium concentrations are low, the parathyroid glands synthesise and secrete PTH, which acts on PTH receptors (PTH1R) on bone and kidney cells. At bone, this leads to enhanced resorption and consequent increased efflux of calcium and phosphate. At the kidney, PTH reduces calcium excretion and enhances 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis, which stimulates intestinal calcium absorption. The net effect is a normalisation of serum calcium levels [3, 7–9]. Elevations in serum calcium outside the normal range activate the calcium-sensing receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on parathyroid cell surfaces, which suppresses PTH secretion [3, 7–9]. Vitamin D activation, and subsequent inactivation, requires a series of enzymatic reactions beginning with hydroxylation in the liver by 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. A second hydroxylation in the kidney, by 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), generates the active form 1,25(OH)2D3, which can bind to the vitamin D receptor. Inactivation requires 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) [3, 7–9]. FGF23 secretion by osteocytes is stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3. At the kidney proximal tubule, FGF binding to the FGF receptor (FGFR)–klotho complex stimulates signalling pathways that decrease PTH transcription and reduce plasma membrane expression of sodium–phosphate transporters resulting in reduced phosphate uptake and increased urinary excretion. FGF23 also reduces synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D by inhibiting CYP27B1 and stimulating CYP24A1 [3, 7] (Fig. 1). In the developing foetus, calcium homeostasis is regulated, in part, by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), while PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 are low in foetal circulation [10]. Fig. 1 Calcium regulation at the parathyroid-bone-kidney-gut axis. Serum calcium concentrations are detected by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on parathyroid cell surfaces. CaSR signalling inhibits PTH secretion. In the presence of low serum calcium or magnesium, this inhibition is relieved, allowing PTH secretion to occur. PTH acts at bone to increase resorption and calcium release, and kidney reducing calcium excretion. At kidney proximal tubules, PTH1R activates signalling pathways that stimulate NaPi-IIa internalisation which reduces phosphate uptake and alters CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 expression, resulting in 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis. Vitamin D activation involves hydroxylation in the liver by 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and at the kidney, by 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), to generate the active 1,25(OH)2D3, which can bind to the vitamin D receptor. Inactivation requires 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1). In the FGF23-klotho axis (shown in green), FGF23 is secreted by osteocytes and binds to the FGF receptor (FGFR)-klotho complex at kidney proximal tubules, where it reduces PTH transcription and plasma membrane expression of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc, resulting in increased phosphate excretion. FGF23 also reduces synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D by inhibiting CYP27B1 and stimulating CYP24A1.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Causes of neonatal hypercalcaemia\\n\\nThe causes of hypercalcaemia in the neonate are often distinct from those in older children and adults. This review will focus primarily on genetic causes of hypercalcaemia in neonates and young infants. Neonatal hypercalcaemia can be due to maternal or neonatal factors and can be divided into high or low PTH disorders (Table 1).\\n\\nHigh serum PTH\\n\\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism\\n\\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) (OMIM #239200) is a rare condition in which affected infants present with marked hypercalcaemia, skeletal demineralisation and failure to thrive, and can be fatal if untreated [11]. In 1993, inactivating mutations in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) (Fig. 1) were identified to cause NSHPT, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH), a milder hypercalcaemic disorder [11]. In the majority of cases (~ 85%), NSHPT is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, while heterozygous mutations cause FHH [12]. However, NSHPT has also been described in a small number of patients with heterozygous CaSR mutations, and it has been hypothesised that the clinical presentation of patients with heterozygous mutations is likely influenced by the location of the mutant residue, as well as intrauterine exposure to maternal calcium and vitamin D, and the presence of other CaSR polymorphisms that could act as genetic modifiers to influence activity of the receptor [12–14].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Individuals with NSHPT usually present within the first 2 weeks post-partum with serum calcium levels of > 4.5 mmol/L [12]. Serum calcium values are higher in patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations and in individuals with nonsense or truncation mutations that severely impact receptor structure [12]. PTH values are high in > 80% of NSHPT patients [12]. The most commonly reported symptoms in NSHPT are skeletal under-mineralisation and/or osteopenia, failure to thrive and hypotonia; while respiratory distress and lethargy are observed in a third of individuals, and dehydration, constipation and nausea/vomiting are observed in < 20% of NSHPT patients [12].\\n\\nParathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment for NSHPT, with bisphosphonates used to reduce hypercalcaemia prior to surgery [15]. Surgery should be performed early to avoid neuromotor restrictions, which may persist after otherwise successful surgery, and has been correlated with microcephaly and the duration or amplitude of hypercalcaemia [16]. The CaSR-positive allosteric modulator, cinacalcet, which enhances receptor sensitivity to extracellular calcium, has successfully reduced PTH and serum calcium in some NSHPT patients [15, 17]. The efficacy of cinacalcet is genotype dependent and may be ineffective in some patients [15, 17]. However, cinacalcet is likely to be increasingly utilised in NSHPT, due to its rapid effect on PTH levels and serum calcium [12].\\n\\nFamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type-1'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='FHH (familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type-1 (FHH1), OMIM #145980) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by lifelong elevated serum calcium levels, high (approximately one-third) or inappropriately normal PTH concentrations and low kidney calcium excretion [12, 18, 19]. FHH1 is usually benign, and although its biochemical features have considerable overlap with typical primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), hypercalcaemia in FHH remains persistent following parathyroidectomy. It is therefore important to distinguish between typical PHPT and FHH to avoid unnecessary surgery [12, 18, 19]. This should involve a combination of genetic analysis, measurement of urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (UCCR) (cut-off of < 0.02 for FHH1) and examination of other symptoms, including kidney stones, fractures and cardiovascular events that are more common in PHPT [12, 18, 19].\\n\\nFHH is rarely detected in infants, and the majority of patients with FHH are asymptomatic (~ 71%). However, some individuals have hypercalcaemic symptoms including constipation, fatigue, headaches, muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting, while other patients present with associated features including nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis and/or fractures and pancreatitis [12]. Treatment of symptomatic hypercalcaemia with cinacalcet has been reported in some adults and young children with FHH1 [20, 21]. However, the safety and efficacy have not been thoroughly examined in children, and the FDA has not approved its use in this age group [21].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the last decade, the genetic heterogeneity of FHH has emerged, with mutations in the Gα11 protein [22], by which CaSR signals, and the adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit (AP2σ) [23], which facilitates CaSR internalisation, demonstrated to cause FHH. AP2σ mutations have been reported to cause a more severe FHH phenotype than those associated with CaSR mutations, with patients often exhibiting higher serum calcium values, symptomatic hypercalcaemia and additional features including recurrent pancreatitis [24]. Despite this, AP2σ mutations were not identified in a cohort of NSHPT patients [25], which may be because homozygous mutations in AP2σ are associated with lethality in mouse models [26], and therefore may not be tolerated in humans. Cinacalcet has been shown to normalise serum calcium and PTH and resolve hypercalcaemic symptoms (headaches, abdominal pain, vomiting, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain) in patients with AP2S1 and GNA11 mutations [27, 28].\\n\\nMaternal hypocalcaemia\\n\\nFoetal serum calcium levels are maintained at a higher concentration than maternal calcium concentrations to allow skeletal formation and mineralisation to take place [29]. Maternal hypoparathyroidism or maternal hypocalcaemia may cause secondary hyperparathyroidism in the neonate [30]. In the presence of severe maternal hypocalcaemia, foetal hypocalcaemia will develop, resulting in stimulation of the foetal parathyroid glands and development of hyperparathyroidism [31]. In severe cases, foetal skeletal demineralisation can lead to sub-periosteal bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica, bowing of the long bones, fractures, low birth weight and foetal death [31]. In most cases, measuring maternal serum calcium and determining whether a familial or maternal history of hypercalcaemia exists are sufficient for diagnosis. The hypercalcaemia in the neonate is usually resolved within a few weeks [31], although some infants have been treated with vitamin D [32].\\n\\nLow serum PTH\\n\\nNutritional causes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Nutritional causes\\n\\nHypercalcaemia can occur in the neonate or young infant following ingestion of excess calcium in enriched formulas. Low dietary phosphate can also cause hypercalcaemia, due to suppression of FGF23 or elevations in 1,25(OH)2D3. This is rare since the introduction of breast milk fortifiers, which contain 30–40 mg kg−1 day−1 of phosphate [3]. Phosphate depletion occurs more frequently in very low birth weight pre-term infants given inappropriately supplemented parenteral nutrition often leading to refeeding syndrome, characterised by hypokalemia, hypoglycaemia and hypophosphatemia [33]. In particular, hypophosphatemia has been associated with parenteral nutrition with a high amino acid content, and formulas with equimolar (0.75:1 to 1:1) Ca2+:PO4 ratios, along with careful monitoring of electrolytes including phosphorus have been recommended to prevent hypercalcaemia and hypophosphatemia [33, 34]. Hypophosphatemia has been described in some infants given correctly prepared formulas, and it has been suggested that bioavailability of phosphorus may be suboptimal in some infants in the context of gastrointestinal disease or tube feeding [35]. Formula change and/or phosphate supplementation improved hypophosphatemia in these infants [35].\\n\\nExcessive vitamin D intake, either by the infant or the breast-feeding mother can lead to increased intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, enhanced bone resorption, and consequently hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia [6]. Rehydration therapy with furosemide usually resolves hypercalcaemia in these infants, although bisphosphonates have been used in patients in which 25(OH)D remained high [36].\\n\\nHypercalcaemia has been reported in some infants receiving enteral feeding formulas containing excess vitamin A. The metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid, can bind to receptors on osteoclasts and osteoblasts, resulting in increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation [6].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Jansen’s metaphyseal chondrodysplasia\\n\\nJansen’s metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC, OMIM #156400) is an autosomal dominant disease characterised by short-limbed short stature, deformed, under-mineralised bones, chronic hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphaturia. Most patients have low or undetectable serum PTH levels and elevated serum markers of bone turnover [37].\\n\\nJMC is very rare, with fewer than 30 reported cases to date [38]. It is caused by mutations in the receptor for PTH and PTHrP, parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) [39], a GPCR that is expressed in cells of bone and kidney. The majority of mutations arise de novo, although some familial cases have been described [40]. All reported mutations occur in three residue positions His223, Thr410 and Ile458 (located in transmembrane helices 2, 6 and 7, respectively), which are located in a bundle at the cytoplasmic face of the receptor [39, 41]. Structural models indicate these residues contribute to a network that controls the outward movements of the transmembrane helices, allowing formation of a cavity at which G proteins can engage with the cytoplasmic region of the receptor during activation [37]. Such a critical role for these residues in receptor activation is consistent with in vitro findings that JMC mutations are associated with ligand-independent constitutive activation of cAMP signalling [39]. This is despite reduced receptor cell surface expression.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='JMC initially presents as a generalised skeletal dysplasia, but as patients age it becomes apparent that the metaphyses are preferentially affected, with progressive expansion and irregular ossification, resulting in short and bowed legs and short hands with clubbed fingers [38, 40]. This can be explained by the very high expression of PTH1R in proliferating chondrocytes of the growth plates. Patients with JMC may also exhibit micrognathia, hypertelorism, high-arched palate, delayed tooth eruption or impaction and a sclerotic skull base [38]. Such growth abnormalities are often not apparent at birth and initial symptoms may present as difficulty in feeding, vomiting, dehydration or respiratory distress within the first few months of life [38, 42]. However, X-rays of infants with JMC show bony lesions comprising rachitic changes, radiolucency and irregularities of the metaphyses of the long bones [30].\\n\\nThe metaphyseal irregularities and skeletal hypo-mineralisation can be mistaken for hypophosphatemic rickets; however, the biochemical findings are inconsistent with this diagnosis [43]. Neonates with JMC have severe, but largely asymptomatic hypercalcaemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, elevated circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and low or undetectable levels of PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) [44]. Serum calcium remains high throughout life but reduces with age [44]; however, PTH levels remain suppressed at or below the lower limit of the reference range [45].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Attempts to perform genotype-phenotype correlations have been made, though there are inconsistencies in their findings. Early studies indicated that patients with His223 mutations may have more severe hypercalcaemia. However, it is now recognised that there is considerable variability even within families [40, 44]. There is some evidence that the constitutive activity of the Thr410Arg mutant PTH1R is not as marked as for other receptor mutations, and clinical features in the affected family are less severe, including milder bone dysplasia and serum calcium and phosphate levels occasionally within the normal range [43]. However, it is difficult to confirm these correlations due to the paucity of JMC cases.\\n\\nThere are currently no effective treatments for JMC, although the use of bisphosphonates in older children to reduce hypercalcaemia has been reported [42, 46]. Recently, the effectiveness of an inverse agonist of the PTH1R was tested in a transgenic mouse model expressing the PTH1R-His223Arg mutation in osteoblast cells [37]. Mutant mice showed significant improvements in skeletal parameters including excess trabecular bone mass, bone marrow fibrosis and levels of bone turnover markers, although there was no effect on bone length [37]. Further studies of such PTH1R ligand analogues could reveal new treatment options for JMC patients.\\n\\nIdiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Between the 1930s and 1950s, there was an increase in reported cases of hypercalcaemia in children by clinicians in the UK. Initial observations included failure to thrive, hypercalcaemia and distinct facial features (described as “elfin”). While the hypercalcaemia was transient in some, the facial abnormalities, developmental delay and mental retardation persisted [47]. In 1953, Lightwood and Stapleton suggested that a distinction should be made between those individuals with “syndromic” hypercalcaemia accompanied by distinct facial features and mental retardation, and those with classical features of hypercalcaemia, including thirst, dehydration and polyuria [47]. This latter milder form was termed idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia (IIH, OMIM #143880), and the former named Williams-Beuren Syndrome [8] (see next section). The increased prevalence of IIH in the 1950s in the UK was linked to the high dose of vitamin D fortification in milk and cereals, an initiative that had begun to prevent rickets in the population [47]. An oversensitivity to vitamin D was suggested to be the cause of hypercalcaemia in those individuals with IIH [47].\\n\\nIIH classically presents in the first year of life with typical symptoms of hypercalcaemia, including failure to thrive, weight loss, dehydration, polyuria, vomiting and lethargy [48]. Hypercalcaemia results from intestinal hyperabsorption [49] and is accompanied by suppressed intact PTH and hypercalciuria [8]. Nephrocalcinosis is also observed on kidney ultrasonography in infants from a few months of age [8]. Hypercalcaemia generally resolves before the age of three years, although nephrocalcinosis and persistent hypercalciuria can continue to be common [50]. If diagnosed early, the prognosis of IIH patients can be improved, and extent of nephrocalcinosis limited [50]. Individuals with IIH may have elevated levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D3, although some have inappropriately normal levels [48].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Although early studies had established an association with vitamin D supplementation, an explanation for this link was only provided in 2011 when researchers identified recessive mutations in the CYP24A1 gene in several individuals with IIH [8]. CYP24A1 encodes the cytochrome P450 enzyme 24-hydroxylase, which inactivates 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1) [48]. In this initial report, CYP24A1 mutations were nonsense or missense and inherited in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state [8]. Subsequently, further mutations were identified that were always bi-allelic, although there is some evidence that heterozygous carriers have high normal serum calcium, increased 1,25(OH)2D, and low levels of PTH [48, 51]. Functional analysis revealed the mutations identified in IIH patients led to complete loss of CYP24A1 enzymatic activity [8]. Some CYP24A1 inactivating mutations have been identified in adults with recurrent kidney stone disease and chronic kidney failure [52, 53], with only a subset known to have hypercalcaemia in childhood. Moreover, some CYP24A1 mutations, which tend to be associated with milder hypercalcaemia, are present at a high frequency in the Caucasian population (4–20% on dbSNP), indicating that IIH may go undetected if not challenged by vitamin D supplementation, resulting in increased lifetime risk of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis [54].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In 2016, mutations in a second gene, SLC34A1, which encodes the kidney proximal tubule sodium-phosphate co-transporter NaPi-IIa, were identified in patients with IIH [9]. Again, these mutations were autosomal recessive and led to inactivation of the NaPi-IIa protein [9]. This subset of patients not only have the classical symptoms of hypercalcaemia and suppressed PTH but also exhibit hypophosphatemia due to kidney phosphate wasting [8]. Functional expression of the IIH-associated mutant NaPi-IIa demonstrates that the transporter fails to traffic normally to the surface of cells due to intracellular retention, resulting in defective kidney proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption and hypophosphatemia [8]. Subsequently, the low levels of serum phosphate and FGF23 induce increases in CYP27B1 expression and 1a-hydroxylase activity; while inhibiting CYP24A1 expression and 24-hydroxylase activity, which have the combined effect of increasing 1,25-(OH)2D3 and hypercalcaemia [8]. Mutations in SLC34A1 have also been described in a consanguineous family with an affected individual presenting with renal Fanconi’s syndrome, hypophosphatemic rickets, hypercalciuria and elevated 1,25(OH)2D3 levels [55], and in heterozygous adults with hypophosphatemia and urolithiasis [56]. The clinical biochemistry during infancy in these individuals was not reported, although the younger sister of the individual with Fanconi’s syndrome and hypophosphatemic rickets had hypercalcaemia, suppressed PTH and elevated 1,25(OH)2+D3 levels [55]. Thus, although hypercalcaemia may resolve within the first few years in most individuals, patients may develop other sequelae including nephrolithiasis later in life.\\n\\nWilliams-Beuren syndrome'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Williams-Beuren syndrome, also known as Williams syndrome (OMIM #194050), is a rare genetic multisystem disorder that affects the cardiovascular, connective tissue and central nervous systems. It affects ~1 in 7500–10,000 live births [57, 58]. Although symptoms vary between cases, distinct (“elfin-like”) facial features including microcephaly, broad forehead, rounded cheeks, epicanthal folds, depressed nasal bridge, small mandible and prominent ears are usually present [59, 60]. Dental abnormalities including microdontia, hypoplastic enamel and upper and lower teeth that do not meet properly (malocclusion) can occur in up to 90% of cases and stellate patterns in the iris are common [60]. Many of the developmental defects including mental retardation and poor motor development observed in Williams syndrome are not detected until later in childhood. However, musculoskeletal abnormalities including depression of the breast bone (pectus excavatum), scoliosis or kyphosis are apparent earlier in childhood [60]. In neonates, low birth weight, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, recurrent vomiting, colic and diarrhoea are common, and two-thirds of infants are small for gestational age [30, 60]. Short stature remains a feature in individuals with Williams syndrome [60]. Soft tissue abnormalities including hernias and skin hyperelasticity, as well as hypotonia and chronic urinary tract infections are often observed in Williams syndrome [60]. Cardiovascular defects are the most common cause of death in Williams syndrome patients and are present in over 90% of affected neonates [58, 59]. Cardiac defects include pulmonary stenosis and supraventricular aortic stenosis, and patients have symptoms of fatigue, chest pains, dizziness and heart murmurs [59].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='There are discrepancies in the reported frequency of hypercalcaemia in association with Williams syndrome, ranging from as low as 5% to up to 50% [60, 61]. The high serum calcium levels are usually resolved within the first few years but may recur during puberty [3]. Circulating calcitriol levels are elevated in some patients, and PTH levels are low [3]. Hypercalcaemia is frequently symptomatic with many infants presenting with dehydration, fatigue, abdominal pain and irritability [3, 61]. There is no consensus regarding the pathogenesis of hypercalcaemia, although decreased calcitonin production and abnormal vitamin D metabolism have been implicated [3, 30].\\n\\nWilliams-Beuren syndrome is a microdeletion disorder caused by the loss of 26–28 genes on 7q11.23 [61, 62]. Most cases occur spontaneously, although familial cases have been reported in which there is autosomal dominant inheritance [60]. Hemizygosity of the elastin gene (ELN) is seen in over 90% of cases and has been demonstrated to be responsible for the vascular and connective tissue defects in Williams syndrome [62, 63]. Deletion of the LIM kinase gene LIMK1 has been reported to contribute to the visuo-spatial cognition problems associated with Williams syndrome [64]. Deletion of the other 24-26 genes on 7q11.23 is likely to be responsible for other symptoms observed in Williams syndrome patients, including hypercalcaemia. One candidate, the Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF), has been hypothesised to regulate vitamin D receptor trans-repression of the CYP27B1 gene [3] (Fig. 1).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Several treatment options have been used for hypercalcaemia in IIH and Williams syndrome. Vitamin D supplementation must be stopped immediately in all cases and rehydration performed. Rehydration therapy combined with furosemide is often successful in reducing serum calcium in patients with Williams syndrome; however, some children are unresponsive and require further treatment [65]. Bisphosphonates have been used to treat hypercalcaemia in several cases of Williams syndrome [65, 66]. Serum calcium levels remained normal in these infants and adverse effects were not observed [65, 66]. A number of studies have demonstrated a low calcium diet is effective in treating hypercalcaemia in IIH and Williams syndrome, although this must be closely monitored due to its potential to induce calcium deficiency and rickets [8, 61, 67]. Moreover, low calcium diet may not successfully normalise serum calcium and PTH levels [8]. Often, corticosteroids are used for the treatment of symptomatic hypercalcaemia as they can inhibit enteral calcium absorption and induce CYP24A1 expression [48]. However, a study of adults with CYP24A1 mutations showed corticosteroids fail to lower serum calcium levels, normalise PTH levels and decrease urinary calcium excretion in some individuals [52]. Use of corticosteroids should be short to avoid their well-documented side effects [67].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Descriptions of the successful use of calcitonin, which inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and enhances kidney calcium excretion, have also been described to treat hypercalcaemia, in combination with thiazide diuretics to reduce hypercalciuria [68]. However, repeated administration of calcitonin leads to tachyphylaxis within 48 h, limiting its long-term use [67]. The administration of cellulose phosphate, which binds calcium with high affinity thereby inhibiting intestinal absorption, has also been described to successfully resolve hypercalcaemia in IIH, although this treatment is not available in some countries [67].\\n\\nInborn errors of metabolism\\n\\nHypophosphatasia (OMIM #171760) is caused by inactivating mutations in the tissue non-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) encoded by the ALPL gene [69]. TNSALP hydrolyses pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase to generate inorganic phosphate, which is required for hydroxyapatite formation and skeletal mineralisation [3, 70]. It can be detected biochemically as low serum ALP activity, with mutation analysis of ALPL providing confirmation [69].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Hypophosphatasia can present in various forms in neonates and infants and has a prevalence of 1:300,000 in Europe and 1:182,000 in Japan [70]. The most severe form, known as perinatal hypophosphatasia, is characterised by profound skeletal hypo-mineralisation [69]. Infantile hypophosphatasia presents before six months of age [70]. Affected newborns appear healthy, but develop poor feeding, inadequate weight gain, wide fontanels and rachitic deformities that can result in respiratory complications [69]. Hypercalcaemia can occur due to impaired skeletal calcium uptake. In those individuals that survive infancy, persistent rickets, bony craniosynostosis and muscle weakness can occur [69]. Until recently, survival from perinatal hypophosphatasia was rare; however, a recombinant enzyme replacement therapy, asfotase alfa, substantially improves bone mineralisation, respiratory function and survival in perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia [71]. The severity of hypophosphatasia generally reflects the inheritance pattern of ALPL mutations, with autosomal recessive inheritance more common in perinatal and infantile cases [69].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Blue diaper syndrome or Drummond’s syndrome (OMIM #211000) is so called as affected infants have inadequate intestinal tryptophan absorption, leading to excessive metabolism by intestinal bacteria and accumulation of indican, which gives urine a distinctive blue colour [72]. The syndrome was first described in 1964 in two siblings who presented with a blue discoloration of urine, along with hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis [72]. Other symptoms include fever, irritability, constipation, poor appetite and failure to thrive. Some infants present with eye abnormalities including abnormal eye movements, hypoplasia of the optic disc and microcornea [73]. Although the blue discoloration of urine is often the first indication of the syndrome, this symptom has been reported in patients with faecal colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and urinary tract infections [74, 75]. Therefore, a diagnosis requires a thorough clinical evaluation including a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms to avoid misdiagnosis.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Blue diaper syndrome is extremely rare and therefore estimating incidence is difficult. The inheritance pattern is most likely autosomal recessive. Defects in several proteins that transport amino acids including tryptophan have been proposed, although no mutations in these genes have been identified. Recently, a male infant with blue diaper syndrome with a homozygous frameshift mutation in pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) was described [76]. PCSK1 encodes prohormone convertase 1/3, a serine endoprotease that is required for the processing of precursors of many hormones including insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1. Mutations in PCSK1 have previously been associated with obesity and gastrointestinal disorders including malabsorptive diarrhoea [77, 78]. Notably, the boy described in this case did not have hypercalcaemia [76], and further genetic investigation is required to determine whether PCSK1 mutations are important in other cases of blue diaper syndrome with hypercalcaemia.\\n\\nCongenital glucose-galactose malabsorption is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC5A1 gene that encodes the sodium-dependent glucose transporter-1 (SGLT-1), which is predominantly expressed in the intestinal brush-border membrane [79]. Glucose and galactose are produced by enzymatic breakdown of lactose from breast milk at the brush-border membrane, and are then transported by SGLT-1 into the enterocyte, before diffusion across the basolateral membrane via the facilitated carrier GLUT2 [79]. The low intracellular sodium concentration required to maintain these favourable gradients relies on a basolateral Na+-K+ pump, resulting in net transport of sodium, sugar and water across the epithelium. Consequently, patients with inactivating mutations in SGLT-1 present with severe life-threatening watery diarrhoea dehydration and abdominal distension in the first weeks of life.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The majority of mutations in SGLT-1 are nonsense, frameshift or splice site, resulting in truncated proteins that are not expressed [79]. Missense mutations have been reported, which do not affect protein expression, but impair the transport ability of the protein [79, 80]. Hypercalcaemia occurs in ~20% of cases and can be accompanied by nephrocalcinosis and elevated 1,25(OH)2D3 [80]. Upregulation of epithelial calcium channels (TRPV6) and 1,25(OH)2D3 have been hypothesised to contribute to nephrocalcinosis and hypercalcaemia [80]. Restriction of glucose, galactose, sucrose and lactose from the diet rapidly resolves symptoms in most patients.\\n\\nAnother rare autosomal recessive disorder, congenital lactase deficiency, has a similar clinical presentation to glucose-galactose malabsorption [81]. Neonates frequently exhibit hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis. Congenital lactase deficiency is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for lactase (LCT). A lactose-free diet usually leads to rapid recovery.\\n\\nAdditional causes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Additional causes\\n\\nSubcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is another rare cause of hypercalcaemia that normally arises within a few weeks of birth [3, 82]. The condition often occurs following traumatic birth and is characterised by painful, firm nodules over the body that are hypothesised to form following cold- or stress-induced injury to immature fat, resulting in necrosis and granulomatous infiltrate [82]. Subcutaneous fat necrosis can occur in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with moderate therapeutic hypothermia [83]. Although subcutaneous fat necrosis usually self-resolves, the associated hypercalcaemia, caused by a combination of calcium release from necrotic tissue and excess calcitriol and prostaglandin E activity from the granulomatous reaction, can be fatal [3]. Hypercalcaemia associated with subcutaneous fat necrosis has been shown to respond to furosemide and glucocorticoid treatment, although an increased incidence of nephrocalcinosis may occur in these infants. Bisphosphonate treatment successfully resolved serum calcium levels and had a reduced risk of recurrent hypercalcaemia [84].\\n\\nHypercalcaemia has been reported in neonates with the kidney tubular disorder Bartter’s syndrome. The affected infants had mutations in the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter NKCC2 (encoded by SLC12A1) and the potassium channel ROMK (encoded by KCNJ1) [85, 86]. Patients with this form of Bartter’s, occasionally known as hyperprostaglandin E syndrome, have increased release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the plasma and urine. The basis of hypercalcaemia in these patients is uncertain, although elevated PGE2 may contribute as studies have shown it can stimulate bone resorption, increase PTH secretion and upregulate hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [86].'),\n",

Heterozygous mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C) gene have been identified in some cases, and inheritance may involve maternal imprinting [87]. As only a few cases have been reported, the cause of hypercalcaemia is unclear.\\n\\nHypercalcaemia may occur in association with a number of endocrine disorders including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Neonatal hyperthyroidism is usually associated with maternal Graves’ disease but can occur in rare endocrine disorders including autosomal dominant non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism due to activating mutations in the TSH receptor gene, McCune-Albright syndrome due to activating mutations in the GNAS gene, encoding the G-protein alpha-s and mutations in the thyroid receptor beta gene. Mild hypercalcaemia has been reported in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. Treatment of these infants with levothyroxine increases circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 and hypercalciuria, contributing to hypercalcaemia [88]. In patients with adrenal insufficiency, hypercalcaemia may be related to reduced calcium reabsorption at the proximal tubule due to hypovolemia and consequent reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or due to increased 1α-hydroxylase activity [89]. Rare cases of PTHrP-secreting tumors have been reported in neonates. PTHrP acts on the PTH1R to cause hypercalcaemia. A number of other causes of hypercalcaemia have been reported in neonates and infants including medications (such as thiazides and lithium) and extremely rare disorders, which have been well described in a review from 2005 [90].\\n\\nKey Summary Points\\n\\nSerum calcium levels are higher in neonates than older children and adults.

The\\xa0characteristics and severity of XLH vary between patients. Because of its rarity, the diagnosis and specific treatment of XLH are frequently delayed, which has a detrimental effect on patient outcomes. In this Evidence-Based Guideline, we recommend that the diagnosis of XLH is based on signs of rickets and/or osteomalacia in association with hypophosphataemia and renal phosphate wasting in the absence of vitamin\\xa0D or calcium deficiency. Whenever possible, the\\xa0diagnosis should be confirmed by molecular genetic analysis or measurement of levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) before treatment. Owing to the multisystemic nature of the disease, patients should be seen regularly by multidisciplinary teams organized by a metabolic bone disease expert. In this article, we summarize the current evidence and provide recommendations on features of the disease, including new treatment modalities, to improve knowledge and provide guidance for diagnosis and multidisciplinary care.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nIntroduction\\nX-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by mutations in PHEX (located at Xp22.1), which encodes a cell-surface-bound protein-cleavage enzyme (phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase PHEX), predominantly expressed in osteoblasts, osteocytes and teeth (odontoblasts and cementoblasts). XLH is the most common cause of inherited phosphate wasting, with an incidence of 3.9 per 100,000 live births and a prevalence ranging from 1.7 per 100,000 children to 4.8 per 100,000 persons (children and adults)1–3. Although the pathogenesis of XLH is not fully understood, animal studies indicate that loss of Phex function results in enhanced secretion of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), with osteocytes being the primary source of FGF23 production4. These effects explain most of the characteristic features of the disease, including renal phosphate wasting with consequent hypophosphataemia, diminished synthesis of active vitamin\\xa0D (1,25(OH)2 vitamin\\xa0D), rickets, osteomalacia, odontomalacia and disproportionate short stature4–6. Patients usually develop clinical symptoms during the first or second year of life. Early treatment with oral phosphate supplementation and active vitamin\\xa0D heals rickets, limits dental abscess formation and prevents progressive growth failure, but in a substantial proportion of patients treatment is unsuccessful and/or associated with adverse effects (for example, hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis)7,8. Up to two-thirds of children with XLH require lower limb surgery9–12. Conventional therapy further stimulates FGF23 levels and thereby renal phosphate wasting, resulting in a vicious circle, which might limit its efficacy6,13–15. Adult patients with XLH are at risk of complications such as early osteoarthritis, enthesopathies, spinal stenosis, pseudofractures and hearing loss, which might limit quality of life16–18. In 2018, burosumab, a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody neutralizing FGF23, was approved by health authorities for the treatment of patients with XLH in the European Union and the USA on the basis of encouraging clinical trial results19–25. Treatment with phosphate and/or active vitamin\\xa0D does not decrease or prevent the development of osteoarthritis or enthesopathies17,26. Currently, evidence that treatment with burosumab ameliorates these complications is lacking.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Owing to the rarity of XLH and the diversity of clinical manifestations, diagnosis is often delayed and treatment can be challenging. To date, except for brief guidance provided by two expert groups, no evidence-based, systematically developed recommendations for the diagnosis and management of XLH exist7,8. Therefore, an initiative to develop recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with XLH was conducted from June 2017 to December 2018, and the recommendations are provided in this Evidence-Based Guideline. These clinical practice recommendations are endorsed by the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN), the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE), the European Society of\\xa0Endocrinology (ESE), the European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions (Endo-ERN), the European Reference Network on Rare Bone Disorders (BOND), the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) Skeletal Rare Diseases Working Group, the European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS), the European Paediatric Orthopaedic Society (EPOS) study group on Metabolic and Genetic Bone Disorders, the European Society of Craniofacial Surgery, the European Society for Paediatric Neurosurgery and the European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) and will be revised and endorsed periodically.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Material and methods\\nOverview of the guideline project\\nWe followed the RIGHT (Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare) Statement for Practice Guidelines27. Two groups were assembled: a core leadership group and a voting panel. The core group comprised specialists from (paediatric) endocrinology (D.S., M.L.B., L.S., P.K., L.R. and A.L.), paediatric nephrology (D.H., F.E., J.B., D.B., F.S. and E.L.), paediatric orthopaedic surgery (D.E. and P.W.), rheumatology (K.B.), dentistry (M.B.D. and C.C.), neurosurgery (F.D.R.) and XLH patient organization representatives (P.H. and M.K.). The voting group included 41 members with expertise in paediatric and adult XLH, including members of the supporting societies and networks. Voting group members were asked by use of an e-questionnaire to provide a level of agreement on a five-point scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree/disagree, agree or strongly agree) (Delphi method). Failing a 70% level of consensus, recommendations were modified after discussion in the core group and reviewed again by the voting panel until a consensus level of at least 70% was achieved.\\n\\nDeveloping the PICO questions\\nWe developed PICO (patient (or population) covered, intervention, comparator and outcomes) questions28. These PICO elements were arranged into the questions to be addressed in the literature searches. Each PICO question then formed the basis for a recommendation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The population covered included children and adults with XLH. Recommendations have been developed on the basis of available studies investigating the clinical phenotype and management of XLH. For these recommendations, treatment benefits were evaluated using the no treatment option or patient status at baseline (that is, before therapy) as the comparator. With regard to outcomes, we provide recommendations for diagnosis, follow-up and treatment with respect to bone disease, growth, treatment-associated or disease-associated complications and comorbidities.\\n\\nLiterature search\\nThe PubMed database was searched until 26 June 2018; all articles and reports were considered, including prospective randomized controlled trials, uncontrolled or observational studies, registries, summaries and case reports, restricted to human studies in English. The following key MeSH terms were used to identify suitable studies: “X-linked hypophosphatemia”, “X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets”, “hypophosphatemic rickets”, “familial hypophosphatemic rickets”, “PHEX” and “osteomalacia”. The search retrieved 8,903 results and 196 articles were referenced here.\\n\\nGrading system\\nWe followed the grading system from the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop the recommendations (Fig.\\xa01; refs29,30). The quality of evidence is graded high (A), moderate (B), low (C), very low (D) or not applicable (X). The latter refers to exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed and benefit or harm clearly predominates. This letter was used to grade contraindications for burosumab and safety recommendations for cinacalcet. The strength of a recommendation is graded strong, moderate, weak or discretionary (when no recommendation can be made).Fig. 1 Determining levels of evidence and strength of recommendations (American Academy of Pediatrics grading matrix).\\nReproduced with permission from ref.30: Pediatrics 140, e20171904 Copyright © 2017 by the AAP.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Diagnosis\\nGeneral approach\\nThe diagnosis of XLH is based on the association of clinical, radiological and biochemical findings (Box\\xa01). In patients with a negative family history (approximately one-third of reported patients31,32), mutational analysis of the PHEX gene is recommended, which can provide negative or positive confirmation in ~70–90% of cases31,33–43. Specific molecular genetic defects such as large deletions, deletions removing pseudo-exons of PHEX or mosaicism can be difficult to identify44,45. With atypical clinical presentations and/or negative genetic analyses, further biochemical, molecular genetic and radiological work-up is recommended. The identification of a pathogenic PHEX variant in an index case requires genetic counselling and enables screening of relatives at risk.\\n\\nBox 1 Recommendations for diagnosis \\nIn children, a diagnosis of X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) should be considered in the presence of clinical and/or radiological signs of rickets, impaired growth velocity and serum levels of phosphate below the age-related reference range associated with\\xa0renal phosphate wasting and in the absence of vitamin\\xa0D or calcium deficiency (grade B, moderate recommendation)\\n\\nIn adults, the diagnosis of XLH should be considered in the presence or history of lower limb deformities, and/or clinical and/or radiological signs of osteomalacia (including pseudofractures, early osteoarthritis and enthesopathies) in the context of serum levels of phosphate below the age-related reference range associated with renal phosphate wasting (grade B, moderate recommendation)\\n\\nWe recommend that any first-generation family member of a patient with XLH should be investigated for XLH (grade D, weak recommendation); sons of males affected by XLH are not at risk'),\n",

Dental abscesses are highly prevalent in patients >3 years of age46,47. In\\xa0undiagnosed adults, typical findings of XLH include short stature, osteomalacia, bone pain, osteoarthritis, pseudofractures, stiffness, enthesopathies and poor dental condition including periodontitis (inflammation of the gums)16–18,48–50. Osteomalacia-related bone pain needs to be distinguished from osteoarthritis-related bone pain. Rachitic skeletal deformities usually become apparent at the age of 6 months. During the second year of life, patients present with delayed walking, a waddling gait, progressive lower limb deformities (varus deformity or valgus deformity) often combined with a torsional component (intoeing or extoeing), widening of the distal metaphyses at the wrist and ankle level, thickening of the costochondral junctions and reduced growth velocity51. Impaired limb growth with relatively preserved trunk growth results in disproportionate short stature7,8,17,49,52. Patients might present with an abnormal skull shape — that is, dolichocephaly, characterized by parietal flattening, frontal bossing and widened sutures as the consequence of premature fusion of the parietal and frontal bones53,54.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Radiographic manifestations\\nRachitic lesions are characterized by cupped and flared metaphyses and widened and irregular physes (growth plates) of the long bones. In contrast to rickets that is secondary to vitamin\\xa0D or calcium deficiency, in XLH, cortical bone often appears thickened and features of bone resorption are lacking. These abnormalities preferentially occur at sites of rapid growth (in particular the distal femora, distal tibiae and distal radii) and typically affect costochondral junctions, which leads to the development of the rachitic rosary and Harrison’s groove. Radiography limited to the knees and/or wrists and/or the ankles is usually sufficient to diagnose rickets8. Bone deformities primarily involve lower limbs (Fig.\\xa02). Adults might present with different radiographic features from children, including pseudofractures, early osteoarthritis of the spine, hip and knees (osteophytes on joint margins or narrowing of joint cartilage) and/or enthesopathies (such as bone proliferation at the site of ligament attachments or calcification of ligaments)16,17. Osteomalacia-related fractures are rarely observed in adults, whereas pseudofractures are frequently observed in adults16,17,55,56.Fig. 2 Radiographs of the lower extremities of children affected with X-linked hypophosphataemia.\\nThe patients show disproportionate short stature with genu varum (bowed legs). The final panel on the right shows a patient with a windswept deformity (characterized by a valgus deformity in one knee in association with a varus deformity in the other knee). The radiographs reveal severe leg bowing, partial fraying and irregularity of the distal femoral and proximal tibial growth plates. Note the lack of bone resorption features.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nBiochemical characteristics\\nThe biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels7,8. A\\xa0positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life57,58. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)59 (Table\\xa01). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia60. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin\\xa0D therapy2,14,15,60. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients6. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table\\xa02), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used14,61. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH)2 vitamin\\xa0D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin\\xa0D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia6,62–64.Table 1 Initial evaluation of common and rare complications of XLH'),\n",

Other types of hypophosphataemic rickets have similar but not identical clinical and radiological features58. Other causes of hypophosphataemia must be considered in patients with a negative family history, male-to-male transmission or unusual clinical presentation, such as symptoms developing after the second year of life (autosomal dominant hypophosphataemic rickets or tumour-induced osteomalacia), acidosis, glucosuria, aminoaciduria or low molecular mass proteinuria (renal Fanconi syndrome), low urinary phosphate levels (dietary phosphate deficiency or impaired bioavailability) or hypercalciuria before starting treatment (hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH)) (Table\\xa02). The differential diagnoses are based on the mechanisms leading to hypophosphataemia\\xa0— namely, high PTH activity, inadequate phosphate absorption from the gut or renal phosphate wasting. The latter might be the result of either primary tubular defects or high levels of circulating FGF23 (refs66–68) (Fig.\\xa03; Table\\xa02). Extended molecular genetic analysis can be helpful to establish the diagnosis in unclear cases of hypophosphataemic rickets69–71. Nutritional rickets and XLH might sometimes coexist, and diagnosis of XLH should be considered in someone otherwise thought to be vitamin\\xa0D or calcium deficient if serum levels of phosphate do not improve after supplementation.Fig. 3 Algorithm for the evaluation of a child with rickets presenting with hypophosphataemia.\\nThe differential diagnoses are based on the mechanisms leading to hypophosphataemia — namely, high parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity, inadequate phosphate absorption from the gut or renal phosphate wasting.

In adults, bone-specific ALP is preferred given that ~50% of circulating ALP originates from hepatocytes84. When rachitic or osteomalacic bones are undertreated, ALP levels are elevated and urinary levels of calcium are usually low. By contrast, when rickets is healed, ALP levels tend to normalize and urinary calcium levels start to increase7,8.

However, starting doses of 20–60\\u2009mg/kg body weight daily (0.7–2.0\\u2009mmol/kg daily) based on elemental phosphorus are recommended on the basis of the severity of the phenotype. Early treatment is associated with superior outcomes18,26,32,49,50,75,112–115. Healing of rickets, as evidenced by the normalization of ALP levels and radiological signs, is the initial aim in children8,32,116. Treatment also promotes growth, reduces bone pain, progressively corrects leg deformities and improves dental health48,50,52,63,74,75,81–83,85,111,117. In infants diagnosed before they develop bone changes, the goal of treatment is to prevent rickets. Serum phosphate levels increase rapidly after oral intake but return to baseline concentrations within 1.5 hours63. Thus, phosphate should be given as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times per day in young patients with high ALP levels, to maintain stable blood levels. Less frequent dosing (2–3\\xa0times daily) might improve adherence in adolescents. Fasting phosphate levels are not restored by oral phosphate supplements, and normalization of serum levels of phosphate is not a goal of conventional therapy7,8. Phosphate supplements are available as oral solutions, capsules or tablets containing sodium-based and/or potassium-based salts. Dosages should always be based on elemental phosphorus given that the phosphorus content largely differs between the available phosphate salts. Oral solutions containing glucose-based sweeteners should be used with caution given the dental fragility of these patients.

The equivalent dosage of alfacalcidol is 1.5–2.0 times that of calcitriol on the basis of studies in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease and observations in patients with XLH8,119. This difference is probably because of the roughly twice higher oral bioavailability of calcitriol than alfacalcidol.

Currently, with improvements in medical care, limb deformity improves in most patients, persists in others and progresses to a severe deformity in a minority9,10,52,160. Surgical approaches now include the less invasive techniques of guided growth surgery performed early in childhood, which contrast with the active delay of corrective surgery using complex osteotomies until the patient is skeletally mature9,160. In guided growth surgery, a small metal plate is placed on the medial or lateral surface of the bone (for valgus or varus deformities) at the level of the physis (growth plate). A screw is placed into the bone at either side of the growth plate, and the device then acts as a tether to growth near the plate but not at the opposite side of the bone. Thus, with time, the differential growth allows the alignment to improve, and when the bone is straight, the plate is removed and normal growth continues.\\n\\nThis change in both medical and surgical treatment philosophies makes it difficult to make firm recommendations at this stage161–164 (Box\\xa09).\\n\\nBox 9 Recommendations for orthopaedic management in children with XLH \\nWe do not recommend the use of casts or insoles for the management of lower limb deformity in children with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) (grade C, moderate recommendation)\\n\\nWe suggest emphasizing the importance of weight-bearing exercise, maintenance of joint range and maximizing strength and endurance (grade D, weak recommendation)\\n\\nWe do recommend physiotherapy following surgery or in case of decreased range of movement, muscle weakness, fatigue, instability or physical deconditioning (grade D, weak recommendation)'),\n",

In children who are still growing, a mechanical axis that is progressive through zone 2 despite optimized medical care might also merit treatment160. Treatment at this stage is often simpler, more reliable and less prone to complications than treatment when patients have stopped growing. Substantial deformity might also exist in the sagittal and torsional planes. Deformity in three planes increases the difficulty of any surgical intervention, but often the coronal deformity dominates and correction of this plane improves the overall picture160,165,166.\\n\\nThe aim of surgical treatment is that at skeletal maturity the lower limbs are of equal length, well aligned (that is, with neutral lower limb mechanical axes and horizontal knee and ankle joints) and with mobile, comfortable joints. If possible, this goal should be achieved with the minimum amount of surgery, no complications, minimal time off school and/or activities and no functional loss.\\n\\nLower limb deformities can be treated by performing osteotomies at the site or sites of major deformity and correcting in all three planes. The osteotomy could result in acute correction of the deformity with internal fixation or gradual correction of deformity using external fixation techniques9,117,122,159,160,167. Such surgery is associated with notable rates of recurrence and of complications, especially in young children and in patients with poor metabolic control. In one study, 57% patients (28\\xa0of 49) experienced at least one complication of surgery, with recurrent deformity in 29% of patients9.

       " Document(page_content='Guided growth techniques have been gaining popularity165. This surgical strategy should commence early after 12 months if deformity persists despite maximized medical therapy. The rationale for this therapy is to correct the deformity at the physis before significant diaphyseal deformity develops. With correction of the mechanical axis, the forces directed across the physes and the joints are normalized, thus promoting normal growth. This technique does not require immobilization. The limitation of this strategy is that it provides only uniplanar coronal correction without correction of the tibial medial torsion. Torsional alignment often improves simultaneously. Both varus and valgus deformities correct readily and rapidly, but genu varum might respond less in adolescents160. In growing children, guided growth techniques might lead to overcorrection if the plates are left in situ for too long. Rebound deformity after plate removal has been reported, although rarely12,160,168,169.\\n\\nWhether or not deformity correction at the knee results in some correction distally at the ankle is debated160,168.

Cementum thickness, a central component of the periodontium, is reduced and associated with mineralization defects of the alveolar bone, which impairs the attachment of the ligament fibres18,171.

Continued supplementation through adulthood may be beneficial, as the number of dental abscesses and severity of periodontitis vary according to the percentage of adult life with treatment18,26.\\n\\nTo prevent bacterial invasion of the dentin and pulp via enamel microcracks, we suggest sealing the occlusal surfaces of both deciduous and permanent teeth in children with XLH174.

       " Document(page_content='Rachitic rosaryThe prominent knobs of bone at the costochondral joints in\\xa0patients with rickets (also\\xa0known as beading of the ribs); the knobs create the appearance of large beads under the skin of the rib cage, hence the name by analogy with the beads of a Catholic Christian rosary.\\n\\nHarrison’s grooveA horizontal groove along the lower border of the thorax corresponding to the costal insertion of the diaphragm (also known as Harrison’s sulcus); it appears in rickets because of defective mineralization of the bone — the diaphragm, which is always in tension, pulls the softened bone inward.\\n\\nIntercondylar and/or intermalleolar distanceThe distance between knees (intercondylar) and ankles (intermalleolar). It is used to assess the severity of valgus or varus leg deformities. However, it varies with age and cannot replace regular orthopaedic assessment owing to the high complexity of leg deformities (for example, torsion of limbs) in many patients.\\n\\nCraniosynostosisA condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in a very young skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification); because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it compensates by growing more in the direction parallel to the closed sutures.\\n\\nOsteotomiesSurgical procedures in which the bone is cut, the two ends realigned to improve shape and/or length and stabilized with internal or external fixation.\\n\\nMechanical axisA line drawn from the centre of the femoral head to the centre of the ankle joint; in a patient who is standing, this line should pass through the centre of the knee. When it does not do so, the mechanical axis is\\xa0deviated.\\n\\nRetrognathismA type of malocclusion that refers to an abnormal posterior positioning of the maxilla (the upper fixed bone of the jaw).'),\n",

They can be clinically classified based on radiographic and physical features, and many can be further defined at a molecular level (Bonafe et al., 2015). Early diagnosis is critical to proper medical management including pharmacologic treatment when available. Patients with severe skeletal dysplasias often have small chests with respiratory insufficiency or airway obstruction and require immediate intubation after birth. Thereafter a variety of orthopedic, neurosurgical, pulmonary, otolaryngology interventions may be needed. In terms of definitive treatment for skeletal dysplasias, there are few pharmacotherapeutic options available for the majority of these conditions. We sought to describe therapies that are currently available or under investigation for skeletal dysplasias.\\n\\nhypophosphatasiamucopolysaccharidosisosteogenesis imperfectaachondroplasiaAsfotase alfaenzyme replacement therapy\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nIntroduction\\nA skeletal dysplasia is diagnosed in 1 of 5,000 births each year (Orioli et al., 1986). Severity is highly variable and can range from mild short stature to perinatal lethality. Among patients with less severe forms that allow survival are many who will require significant care for the duration of their lives. Despite research in the area of skeletal dysplasias that has elucidated a great deal about the genetic pathophysiology of these conditions, there remain limited therapeutic options.\\n\\nThe ability to accurately diagnose a skeletal dysplasia in utero has improved in recent years due to advances in prenatal ultrasound and molecular diagnosis. There are, however, limitations to ultrasound; certain skeletal dysplasias may not be seen until the third trimester (e.g., some forms of osteogenesis imperfecta), while others may manifest as late as infancy or early childhood (e.g., pseudoachondroplasia). In general, the earlier the dysplasia manifests, the more significant are its effects in terms of prenatal and postnatal morbidity and mortality. When sonographic findings are present, parents benefit from prenatal counseling and anticipatory guidance. Understanding the inheritance pattern is also important to direct recurrence risk estimates for future pregnancies, particularly when both parents are affected with a skeletal dysplasia. Inheritance depends on the specific dysplasia and may include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked inheritance, or a combination of these when both parents are affected.\\n\\nMedical management of patients with skeletal dysplasias is dictated by the underlying pathogenesis along with the type and severity of physical manifestations in the realm of orthopedics, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and pulmonary services. Pharmacologic treatment for these conditions is disease-specific (Table 1), and 4 conditions/groups will be discussed.\\n\\nTable 1 Therapeutic options for skeletal dysplasias.'),\n",

There are over a dozen types of OI with a prevalence of 1–2 per 20,000 children (Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). Pathogenic mutations in OI have been uncovered in the following genes: COL1A1, COL1A2, SERPINF1, CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, SERPINHI, or FKBP10. The majority of cases are due to an autosomal dominant mutation in COL1A1 and COL1A2 resulting in types I–IV, classified based on severity (Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). These mutations affect formation of type I collagen, which is the most prominent connective tissue in bone and skin.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Type I patients have a quantitative deficiency of collagen and often have blue sclerae and fractures without deformity. Patients with Types II–IV have defective forms of collagen caused by improper formation of the triple helix resulting in continual remodeling with a dominant negative effect. Type II OI is perinatally lethal, due to severe intrauterine fractures and bone deformities (Harrington et al., 2014). Type III is the most severe nonlethal type of OI, presenting with normal mental capacity (Krakow, 2015) and progressive deformities resulting in loss of ambulatory abilities (Krakow, 2015). Type IV OI is milder than type III, but still severe, commonly characterized by vertebral fractures and short stature (Krakow, 2015). Types II and III are generally detectable in utero (Krakow et al., 2008; Krakow, 2015), whereas the milder types of OI, types I, IV, and V, are usually diagnosed after birth (Harrington et al., 2014). Patients with type II and type III OI likely have a small chest cavity, and may require mechanical ventilation if demise is not inevitable secondary to severe fractures (Harrington et al., 2014).\\n\\nIn addition to the autosomal dominant mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2, 5–10% of cases are due to a mutation in another gene. Type V OI, due to an autosomal dominant mutation in IFTITM5, is recognized by hypercallus formation and calcification of the intraosseous membrane (Liu et al., 2016). An autosomal recessive mutation in SERPINF1 is responsible for type VI (Harrington et al., 2014). Additional types of OI are autosomal recessive and are not well-recognized because they are very rare. Examples include the following types and (genes): type VII (CRTAP), type VIII (LEPRE1), type IX (PPIB), type X (SERPINH1), and Type XI (FKBP10; Harrington et al., 2014; Krakow, 2015).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Of the skeletal dysplasias, osteogenesis Imperfecta currently has the most pharmacologic treatment options. Overall the goal is to improve bone density and decrease fractures, and there are several drug families currently employed to do this (Lee et al., 2016). Medications include bisphosphonates, growth hormones, denosumab, and teriparatide. Additional therapies are under investigation; Raloxifine improves outcomes in murine models, and mesenchymal bone marrow transplant has promise when initiated in utero.\\n\\nBisphosphonates\\nBisphosphonates are one of the major pharmacotherapeutic agents clinically prescribed for OI (Dwan et al., 2014; Harrington et al., 2014). Bisphosphonates suppress bone remodeling and inhibit calcification by inactivating osteoclasts (Dwan et al., 2014; Harrington et al., 2014), which, in turn, decreases areal bone mineral density (aBMD), primarily in the spine, hip, and femur and decreases the incidence of fractures (Ward et al., 2010). There is variation in fracture incidence, aBMD, and bone pain among these agents (alendronate, pamidronate, etc.; Dwan et al., 2014) and in their route of administration (intravenous vs. oral). Adverse side effects to long-term use of bisphosphonates have been found, including cumulative micro damage, cartilage calcification (Sinder et al., 2013; Vasanwala et al., 2016), and osteonecrosis of the jaw in elderly patients (Dwan et al., 2014; Harrington et al., 2014). Bisphosphonates have been found to be less effective after 2–4 years of treatment, so intermittent treatment may be more beneficial in some cases.'),\n",

In a randomized study, recombinant growth hormone (rGH) was combined with bisphosphonate therapy (Antoniazzi et al., 2010). Although, the rate of fractures did not differ, lumbar spine and wrist bone mineral density increased. There was no apparent decrease in fracture rate overall (Harrington et al., 2014), yet the combination of rGH and bisphosphonates has not been shown to increase fracture rate either (Antoniazzi et al., 2010).\\n\\nTeriparatide\\nTeriparatide is a bone stimulating recombinant form of parathyroid hormone used in anabolic therapy to treat osteoporosis (Vahle et al., 2002; Orwoll et al., 2014). When given in concert with bisphosphonate therapy, teriparatide has been shown to increase aBMD (Orwoll et al., 2014) and accelerate the healing of fractures (Rozen et al., 2007) in adults with Type I OI. In more severe forms of OI (types III and IV), teriparatide treatment showed no increase in aBMD compared to control groups (Orwoll et al., 2014).'),\n",

Studies have demonstrated an increase in bone healing by callus formation when teriparatide is combined with BMP-7, a recombinant protein in bones (Morgan et al., 2008). Raloxifene has been shown to decrease the rate of bone fractures in mice (Berman et al., 2016) and may prove to be useful to decrease fractures in future human trials of OI. Denosumab is an antibody currently used to prevent fractures in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (Cummings et al., 2009; Shaker et al., 2015) and is being evaluated to treat OI. Sclerostin antibody has been shown in studies to increase bone formation, therefore improving bone mass (Sinder et al., 2013; Shaker et al., 2015), which is essential to OI preventative measures. Anti-TGFβ therapy may also prove to be beneficial in decreasing osteoblast signaling and bone resorption (Shaker et al., 2015) in future OI treatment.\\n\\nThere are presently no clinically available in utero therapies for any of the skeletal dysplasias, however bone marrow and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation are currently under study for in utero treatment of OI (Mehrotra et al., 2010; Harrington et al., 2014).

       " Document(page_content='Hypophosphatasia\\nHypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare metabolic disorder resulting from a loss-of-function mutation in the ALPL gene with corresponding deficiency of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) (Millán and Plotkin, 2012; Whyte et al., 2015; Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). There are 6 recognized clinical forms of HPP with varied severity, all correlated to insufficient mineralization of bone and teeth as well as osteomalacia in adults (Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). Although, mild forms of HPP are found in adolescents and adults, HPP that manifests in the fetus is almost always associated with infantile and perinatal lethality (Millán and Plotkin, 2012; Yap and Savarirayan, 2016) due to abnormal skeletal development and respiratory complications resulting from a small chest with pulmonary hypoplasia (Nishioka et al., 2006).\\n\\nCurrent treatments for HPP\\nAsfotase alfa is a human recombinant TSNALP currently used to safely treat HPP by reestablishing TSNALP levels for proper degradation of inorganic pyrophosphate and consequential regulated bone mineralization (Nishioka et al., 2006; Whyte et al., 2016; Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). One study of this subcutaneous form of enzyme replacement therapy has demonstrated increased strength and agility as a result of improved bone mineralization (Whyte et al., 2016). An immense increase in perinatal and postnatal survival rates has been observed in patients treated with asfotase alfa (Whyte et al., 2016). In an open label study, infants with a previously perinatal lethal condition who were treated with asfotase alfa survived to have average stature with mainly defects in tooth enamel (Whyte et al., 2012).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Potential treatments for HPP\\nPrior to the availability of asfotase alfa, several treatments were under investigation for HPP. These included bone marrow transplants (Millán and Plotkin, 2012), parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment (Millán and Plotkin, 2012), and fetal gene therapy. Although, fetal gene therapy appeared to improve postnatal development in murine models (Sugano et al., 2011), its potential benefits are no longer under investigation due to the dramatic clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy with asfotase alfa.\\n\\nMucopolysaccharidosis\\nMucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a type of lysosomal storage disease, a rare group of disorders that results in symptoms secondary to a defect in lysosomal function leading to abnormal storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the bones, heart, brain, liver, or spleen (Muenzer, 2014; Regier and Tanpaiboon, 2016). The enzyme deficiency is specific to the type of MPS. MPSs are progressive, so most cases become lethal as the patient ages (Walkley, 2009) as GAG builds up and causes multiple organ failures (Muenzer, 2011). GAGs are also involved in complex secondary signaling pathways which can create permanent cellular damage (Muenzer, 2014), so early diagnosis and treatment are essential to patient longevity (Clarke, 2011). Early diagnosis, however, is often difficult in patients with normal cognitive abilities (Muenzer, 2011; Lachman et al., 2014; Regier and Tanpaiboon, 2016). There are seven types of MPS, each of which is caused by an autosomal recessive disorder, except for MPS II, which is X-linked recessive and generally occurs only in males (Valayannopoulos and Wijbug, 2011; Muenzer, 2014). Current treatments for the mucopolysaccharidoses are focused mostly on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; Clarke, 2011).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) involves intravenous administration of the deficient enzyme specific to each type of MPS (Valayannopoulos and Wijbug, 2011; Haneef and Doss, 2016). ERT is currently used to treat MPS I, MPS II, and MPS VI (Muenzer, 2014; Haneef and Doss, 2016). Its use in the treatment of MPS IV type A (Morquio) is under observational study now that it has been FDA approved (Haneef and Doss, 2016; Regier and Tanpaiboon, 2016). Although, repeated administration ERT may improve some of the symptoms of MPS including respiratory function and mobility, it cannot reverse existing skeletal disease (Muenzer, 2014).\\n\\nMPS I is caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase (IDUA; Wang et al., 2009; Valayannopoulos and Wijbug, 2011; Ou et al., 2016), a critical enzyme in the GAG degradation pathway of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (Kakkis et al., 2001; Muenzer, 2011; Regier and Tanpaiboon, 2016). MPS I is categorized into 3 groups based on its presentation and severity: Hurler's syndrome (severe; lethal by age 10); Hurler-Scheie syndrome (moderate; lethality by age 20); and Scheie's syndrome (mild; possible normal life span; Kakkis et al., 2001). Larodinase is used in ERT for MPS I, and has been shown to safely reverse some MPS symptoms, not including those relating to skeletal disease (Wraith et al., 2004; Muenzer, 2014).\\n\\nMPS II is the only form of MPS that is inherited as an X-linked recessive disorder. It results from a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulphatase (Muenzer, 2011) which, similar to MPS I, leads to insufficient degradation of dermatin sulfate and heparin sulfate (Muenzer, 2011; Haneef and Doss, 2016; Motas et al., 2016). Idursulfase administration has resulted in reduced non-central nervous system symptoms of MPS II (Haneef and Doss, 2016).\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MPS IVA and VI are difficult to distinguish because of their varied presentation (Lachman et al., 2014), however treatment is dependent on the diagnosis. MPS IVA results from deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) corresponding to the buildup of keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S) (Regier and Tanpaiboon, 2016). Clinical treatment for MPS IVA with elsosulfase alfa is underway (Regier and Tanpaiboon, 2016). Galsulfase is currently the only treatment for MPS VI and has been successful in improving pulmonary function and mobility (Motas et al., 2016).\\n\\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and bone marrow transplantation are used to introduce unaffected donor cells into the body and correct the lysosomal disorder by the accompanied addition of the enzyme that was previously lacking (Haneef and Doss, 2016). HCST is recommended in treating Hurler syndrome (MPS I) with ERT pre-treatment for the best results (Clarke, 2011; Muenzer, 2014). HSCT has been less successful in patients with MPS II or severe forms of MPS III (Muenzer, 2014; Motas et al., 2016). Bone marrow transplant was effective in reversing CNS symptoms (Walkley et al., 1994) in MPS I, MPS II, MPS VI, and MPS VII but is associated with a high complication rate (Haneef and Doss, 2016).\\n\\nFuture therapies for MPS\\nChaperone therapy could potentially treat MPS by assisting in the proper folding of proteins to create functional enzymes that break down GAG (Kakkis et al., 2001). Gene therapy is promising in finding a cure for skeletal dysplasias if the mutated gene can be correctly identified and modified to produce functional proteins, but development of this technique will take continued research (Kakkis et al., 2001).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Achondroplasia\\nAchondroplasia (ACH) is an autosomal dominant disorder generally resulting from a specific gain-of-function mutation (G380R) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) (Wang et al., 2013; Krakow, 2015; Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). As the most common type of nonlethal skeletal dysplasia, occurring in 1–2 of every 20,000 live births (Savarirayan and Rimoin, 2002; Yasoda et al., 2009; Klag and Horton, 2016), ACH is the cause for most cases of dwarfism (Klag and Horton, 2016; Yap and Savarirayan, 2016). The common clinical presentation of ACH includes short stature, relative macrocephaly with frontal bossing (Matsushita et al., 2014), and rhizomelic limb shortening (Faruqi et al., 2014; Krakow, 2015). There are usually no cognitive impairments associated with ACH unless symptoms result due to a complication of another manifestation (Gordon, 2000). Severe symptoms may result due to spinal stenosis at the foramen magnum.\\n\\nAbnormal long-bone development typically is not obvious until after the first half of the second trimester thus, early prenatal diagnosis of ACH by ultrasound is not common (Krakow et al., 2008; Krakow, 2015). When achondroplasia is suspected, prenatal molecular diagnosis can be employed to evaluate for the specific G380R mutation, however sequencing of FGFR3 may be preferred if hypochodroplasia is on the list of differential diagnoses. Affected parents may also desire prenatal molecular diagnosis or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to evaluate for a known maternal or paternal mutation (Wang et al., 2013).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Pharmacologic treatments for ACH are currently in stage 2 clinical trials (Wendt et al., 2015; Klag and Horton, 2016). Treatments are aimed at regulating the function of FGFR3 in growth plate formation (Matsushita et al., 2014). FGFR3 negatively regulates bone growth (Faruqi et al., 2014). Its elevated function leads to irregular endochondral ossification (Wendt et al., 2015; Yap and Savarirayan, 2016) and underdeveloped linear bone growth (Liu et al., 2016) resulting from interrupted differentiation of chondrocytes (Yasoda et al., 2009; Wendt et al., 2015; Klag and Horton, 2016).\\n\\nC-type natriuretic peptides (CNP) increased linear bone growth in murine models with ACH by antagonizing FGFR3 signals (Wang et al., 2013; Faruqi et al., 2014; Klag and Horton, 2016). Most CNPs are active in the body for less than 3 min (Klag and Horton, 2016) before they are removed by the natriuretic clearance receptor (NPR C) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) (Wendt et al., 2015). Constant intravenous infusions of these short-lived CNPs would be required to observe any improvement of endochondral ossification in patients (Yasoda et al., 2009; Wendt et al., 2015). BMN 111 (vosoritide) is a type of CNP that is resistant to digestion by NEP, and therefore has a longer circulation period in the body (Klag and Horton, 2016). Recent studies have shown an increased annual linear bone growth in cynomolgus monkeys (Wendt et al., 2015) and in children with ACH after daily subcutaneous administration of BMN 111 (Klag and Horton, 2016). BMN 111 is the most promising of CNP treatments and the only treatment for ACH that has made it to clinical trials (Klag and Horton, 2016).'),\n",

Furthermore, intermittent injection of human parathyroid hormone [PTH] in mice was accompanied by increased chondrogenesis and recovered bone growth (Xie et al., 2012). Human growth hormone (hGH) can increase short-term bone growth velocity in children, but is an ineffective therapy in adults (Savarirayan and Rimoin, 2002; Yasoda et al., 2009; Matsushita et al., 2014). A short-term study found increased chondrogenesis by statin administration, specifically rosuvastatin (Yamashita et al., 2014), but long-term analysis has not been done.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Conclusion\\nThe currently available clinical therapies for patients with skeletal dysplasia are predominantly palliative in nature, however enzyme replacement therapy is now available for certain skeletal conditions. The ability to perform enzyme replacement therapy requires knowledge of the underlying molecular diagnosis as well as the pathogenic pathway by which the mutation affects bone growth and/or development. In addition to enzyme replacement therapy, bone marrow transplant is a less specific form of therapy that is clinically beneficial for several skeletal dysplasias. It is also being trialed in utero for osteogenesis imperfecta. A lack of suitable biomarkers accounts for the deficiency of therapeutic treatments (Briggs et al., 2015). Identifying these biomarkers will enable more useful treatment methods, but there is also associated difficulty with targeting the specific mutations, even when their identity is known (Tomatsu et al., 2013). Advances in molecular technology enable a more rapidly confirmed diagnosis as well as an earlier diagnosis in childhood and even in utero. This is key to allow for useful therapies specific to the underlying diagnosis. Our diagnostic capabilities will allow for a more personalized approach to treatment and targeted gene therapy as a foreseeable approach in the future.\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\nAll authors contributed to the concept and design of this project.

The KP-10-GPR54 system plays an important role in embryonic kidney development. However, its function in osteoblast differentiation is unknown. Osteoblast differentiation is controlled by a range of hormones and cytokines, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs), and multiple transcription factors, such as Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5). In the present study, KP-10-treatment significantly increased the expression of osteogenic genes, including mRNA and protein levels of BMP2, in C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, KP-10 induced BMP2-luc activity and increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9. In addition, NFATc4 specifically mediated KP-10-induced BMP2 gene expression. However, KP-10 treatment did not induce expression of the BMP2 and Runx2 genes in GPR54−/− cells. To examine whether KP-10 induced secretion of BMP2 to the culture medium, we used the conditioned-medium (C.M) of KP-10 treated medium on C3H10T1/2 cells. Dlx5 and Runx2 expressions were higher in GPR54−/− cells treated with C.M than in those treated with KP-10. These results demonstrate that BMP2 protein has an autocrine effect upon KP-10 treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that KP-10/GPR54 signaling induces osteoblast differentiation via NFATc4-mediated BMP2 expression.'),\n",

KP-10 protein binds to G-protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54)1–3. Activation of KP-10 suppresses pulmonary human melanoma1,3,4, and KP-10 is a metastasis suppressor in breast cancer cells5–8. KP-10/GPR54 regulates pubertal development and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Loss of KP-10/GPR54 is associated with the absence of sexual maturation and low levels of gonadotropic hormones in humans and mice9–12. Moreover, GPR54 regulates the expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 7 through nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) c2 and Sp1, and plays an important role in embryonic kidney branching morphogenesis and glomerular development13. Interaction of KP-10, estrogen and BMP4 regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) production in GT1-7 cells14.\\n\\nThe NFAT family comprises five subtypes NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, NFATc4, and NAFTc515. NFATs can regulate cytokine gene expression in immune cells16 and have essential roles in the regulation of immune system17. Calcineurin-NFAT signaling is essential for many stages of vertebrate development18. A previous study indicates that NFAT signaling regulates both osteoblasts and osteoclasts19,20. RANKL-RANK signaling regulates NFATc1 expression during osteoclast differentiation21. In addition, NFATc1 is reported to have crucial roles in the proliferation of osteoblasts. NFATs also function in osteoblasts to regulate factors that are crucial for the recruitment of osteoclast precursors to bone19,22.'),\n",

Among BMPs, BMP2 is the most effective inducer of osteoblast differentiation. In addition, BMP2 regulates early stage of osteoblast differentiation such as Id1, Dlx5, and Runx2 via activating Smad 1/5/926–28. These factors also stimulate expression of marker genes of the next stage of osteogenesis, including ALP and OC29–31.\\n\\nThe role of KP-10 in osteoblast differentiation has not yet been elucidated.

RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that KP-10 significantly increased expression of NFACTc4, whereas there were slight or no changes expression of NFATc1, NFATc3, and NFATc2 (Fig.\\xa03A). KP-10 increased the NFATc4 mRNA level in a time-dependent manner (Fig.\\xa03B).

BMP2-luc activity was also increased by NFATc4 and/or KP-10 (Fig.\\xa03D). To examine the effects of NFATc4 on mineralized nodule formation in osteoblasts alizarin red S staining performed. Overexpressed NFATc4 increased matrix mineralization in C3H10T1/2 cells. But, in GPR54−/− cells was not affected (Fig.\\xa03E). We constructed three types of NFATc4 siRNA primers (siNFATc4I, II and III). Among them, effect of siNFATc4II and III appeared, and next analysis was using the siNFATc4II and III.

In addition, Runx2 (a downstream target gene of BMP2) expression was also not induced by KP-10 treatment in GPR54−/− cells, whereas it was significantly increased in wild-type cells (Fig.\\xa04B).

       " Document(page_content='Discussion\\nIn this study, we first demonstrated that KP-10 stimulated osteoblast differentiation through the BMP2 signaling pathway in C3H10T1/2 cells. Our data provide evidence that KP-10/GPR54 signaling induces osteoblast differentiation via NFATc4-mediated BMP2 expression and activation.\\n\\nKP-10 is important for the regulation of tumor metastasis, puberty onset, and fertility3,28,29. KP-10 and its receptor, GPR54, are key components in the regulation of GnRH secretion in humans and other mammals11,27. However, the role of KP-10/GPR54-mediated signaling in osteoblast differentiation is unknown. Therefore, we focused on the role of KP-10 in osteoblasts. Osteoblasts express various phenotypic markers, including Dlx5, Runx2, and ALP23–25. BMPs play an instrumental role in osteoblast differentiation signaling, and their effects are mediated through Smad signaling30,31. KP-10 positively regulated osteoblast differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells. In addition, KP-10 significantly increased expression of mature osteoblast marker genes (Dlx5, Runx2, and ALP) and ALP activity. Moreover, KP-10 increased BMP2 gene and protein expression. These results suggest that KP-10 regulates osteoblast differentiation though BMP2 in C3H10T1/2 cells.\\n\\nTo gain insights into the mechanisms by which KP-10 regulates osteoblast differentiation, we first evaluated BMP2 signaling because the BMP2-pSmad-Dlx5/Runx2 pathway is involved in osteoblast differentiation34–37. BMP2 regulates Runx2 by activating Smad 1/5/926,27. BMP2 further regulates transcription of osteogenic genes, including Dlx528. KP-10 significantly increased phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/9 in a time-dependent manner as well as expression of the osteogenic markers Runx2 and Dlx5. These results suggest that KP-10-induced osteoblast differentiation is mediated by Smad 1/5/9 and BMP2 signaling.'),\n",

GPR54 regulates BMP7 expression through NFATc2 and Sp1, and plays an important role in embryonic kidney branching morphogenesis and glomerular development13. Interaction of KP-10, estrogen and BMP4 regulates GnRH production in GT1-7 cells14. In this study, KP-10 regulated BMP2 expression through NFATc4 while osteoblast differentiation. The transcription factor NFATc4 is involved in BMP2 transcriptional regulation. Activation of GPR54 by KP-10 led to binding of NFATc4 to the BMP2 promoter. In addition, the KP-10/GPR54 interaction was important for osteoblast differentiation.\\n\\nIn summary, this study demonstrated that KP-10 induces osteoblast differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells.

Although genetic testing of ALDH7A1 is the most definitive diagnostic method, quantifications of pathognomonic metabolites are important for the diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic and dietary interventions. Current metabolite quantification methods use laborious, technically highly complex, and expensive liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectro‐metry, which is available only in selected laboratories worldwide. Incubation of ortho‐aminobenzaldehyde (oABA) with P6C leads to the formation of a triple aromatic ring structure with characteristic absorption and fluorescence properties.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\nDeficiency of antiquitin (ATQ; EC 1.2.1.31) is the most frequent cause of pyridoxine‐/vitamin B6‐dependent epilepsy. ATQ is encoded by ALDH7A1 and mutations compromising dehydrogenase activity lead to an accumulation of alpha‐aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA), which is in reversible equilibrium with the autocyclized Schiff base delta‐1‐piperideine‐6‐carboxylate (P6C1). Both AASA and P6C are elevated in the urine and plasma of ATQ‐deficient patients.2, 3, 4, 5 Elevated levels are decreased during pyridoxine treatment, lysine restricted diet and arginine supplementation (van Karnebeek et al6, 7). A Knoevenagel reaction‐based fusion of P6C with pyridoxal‐5‐phosphate (PLP) and secondary depletion of PLP is likely involved in the clinical symptomatology of affected individuals.1\\n\\n\\nThe state‐of‐the‐art quantification methods of AASA and P6C using plasma and urine are based on liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) methods.3, 4, 5, 8 Quantification of AASA/P6C is not readily available in routine clinical laboratories, both because of the expensive equipment needed and the expertise required to run these highly technological instruments. Only a few laboratories worldwide are able to quantify AASA and P6C to support the diagnosis of ATQ deficiency.8, 9 Early diagnosis through the implementation of a simple and inexpensive P6C quantification method into routine clinical chemistry laboratories might help to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and thus minimise severe neurodevelopmental consequences in ATQ‐deficient patients.\\n\\nFusion of ortho‐aminobenzaldehyde (oABA) with delta‐1‐pyrroline or delta‐1‐piperideine, the autocyclized oxidation products after deamination of putrescine and cadaverine, respectively, generates a triple aromatic ring structure.10, 11, 12 We hypothesized that oABA might also form a similar condensation product with P6C.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Here, we show that the absorption properties of the fusion product between oABA and P6C allow simple, fast, and inexpensive quantification of elevated P6C concentrations in the urine of ATQ‐deficient patients.

The P6C concentration was adjusted to 1\\u2009mM using LC‐MS/MS‐based quantification4 and small aliquots were stored at −30°C.\\n\\n2.2 Analysis of endogenous and exogenous (spiked) P6C in urine\\nThawed urine samples were centrifuged at 10\\u2009000\\u2009rpm for 5 minutes and 90\\u2009μL of the supernatant diluted with 100\\u2009μL water and either 10 μL 10% ethanol (negative control or reference control for the oABA matrix) or 10 μL 20\\u2009mM oABA (A9628, Sigma‐Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) were added. For the quantification of exogenous P6C 10 μL of concentrated P6C at different concentrations and 90\\u2009μL water were used. All samples were analysed in duplicate. oABA was dissolved in 100% ethanol and stored for approximately 6 months at −30°C without an increase in polymerisation or a noticeable reduction of performance. The 200\\u2009μL reaction mixture was incubated in the dark for 2 hours at room temperature. Absorption was measured in a Synergy H1 Multi‐Mode Microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, Vermont) reader and scans performed using 4 nm steps. The absorption values at 460\\u2009nm or the mean of the values at 456/460/464\\u2009nm obtained during absorptions scans from 300 to 600\\u2009nm were used for calculations.

       " Document(page_content='The first block of measurements including repeated measurements of all ATQ deficiency samples and 19 adult healthy controls was performed in April/May 2019. The mean (SD) slope of the four standard curves representing the apparent extinction coefficient was 4035 (668) M−1 cm−1 (Table S2). Additional controls including more adults, as well as children and adolescents of different ages, were measured in October 2019 using the same P6C standard and the same healthy volunteer urine samples frozen in single‐use aliquots. Nevertheless, the mean (SD) apparent extinction coefficient of three experiments decreased to 2517 (204) M−1 cm−1, implying degradation of the P6C standard. The difference between the extinction coefficients measured in May and October is statistically significant (P = .013). To be able to properly compare the April/May data with that from October, we adjusted the October data using a mean factor of 1.61 (see Table S2 for calculations). It might be possible to perform this assay without P6C standard, because the extinction coefficient under specified conditions is an intrinsic parameter. The relative difference between controls and ATQ deficient patients in a given experiment is independent of the extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, proper reactivity of oABA is tested with the P6C standard.\\n\\nA shift of the entire absorption curve by a few nm was observed in less than 5% of wells using UV half‐area 96‐well microtiter plates. Two examples are shown in Figure S8 and the consequences are described in Tables S3 and S4. Under most circumstances, the results will not be relevantly influenced, but in combination with low creatinine concentrations the apparent P6C concentrations can falsely double or even triple. This may be due to a batch problem with our UV plates, but for automated analysis similar observations with other microtiter plates must be properly corrected.'),\n",

The IUPAC name of the condensate between oABA and P6C is 9‐carboxy‐5,5a,6,7,8,9‐hexahydropyrido[2,1‐b]quinazoline‐10‐ium or abbreviated CHHPQ (see Figure S2E). Some absorption and fluorescence properties of CHHPQ generated after incubating oABA with P6C are presented in Figure S1. The postulated molecular weight and some corresponding MS2 fragments were identified using ESI mass spectrometry (Figure S2). Nevertheless, the structures must be considered provisional and verified using NMR or other suitable methods.'),\n",

Quantification of P6C in plasma samples seems possible considering response rates of 80%, but only one ATQ patient showed elevated P6C concentrations (Figure S3C). All ATQ patients in this study received appropriate treatment, and free P6C concentrations are probably too low to use this method for quantification. In addition, it seems that the Knoevenagel condensate between PLP and P6C does not allow fusion with oABA, and excess PLP interferes with oABA/P6C fusion and quantification (Figure S4‐S6).\\n\\n3.2 Urine is amenable for the measurement of the oABA/P6C condensation product\\n\\nALDH7A1 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the kidneys of mice and humans.14, 15 We hypothesized that P6C might be directly excreted into the urine, thus, explaining the generally elevated urine P6C concentrations when compared to plasma (1, 5, 7; Table S1). If P6C is directly excreted into urine, it might escape efficient trapping by PLP. About 90% of circulating PLP is bound to albumin and not filtrated into the urine before intracellular conversion to 4‐pyridoxic acid, which is found at high concentrations in urine but does not react with delta‐1‐pyrroline‐5‐carboxylic acid and is therefore unlikely to react with P6C.16, 17, 18 Experiments with pyridoxamine and pyridoxine did not provide evidence for any interaction with delta‐1‐pyrroline‐5‐carboxylic acid16 and it is improbable that P6C does.'),\n",

Experiments to quantify the condensate of P6C with oABA using fluorescence showed strong and variable quenching, resulting in a nonlinear response and erratic results in healthy volunteers and patients, thus, making a test using this characteristic without separation inadequate for diagnostic testing.\\n\\n4 DISCUSSION\\nIn 2016, about 134.6 million babies were born worldwide. Coughlin et al19 recently published data stating an estimated ATQ deficiency birth incidence of 1 in 64\\u2009352 live births, meaning that it is likely that in 2016, 2100 newborns developed pyridoxine dependent epilepsy. We do not know how many receive a correct and timely diagnosis. Any deferral in starting treatment with pyridoxine might cause more irreversible developmental delay.\\n\\nStockler et al9 suggested that a technically more simpler diagnostic method would facilitate diagnosis and newborn screening. Current LC‐MS/MS‐based methods are available in only a few laboratories worldwide.8, 9 Here, we report on a very simple and inexpensive method to measure P6C in the urine samples of ATQ‐deficient patients, which can be readily implemented in clinical chemistry laboratories worldwide, because only a simple and inexpensive chemical (ortho‐aminobenzaldehyde), urine, and a spectrophotometer or microplate reader with an absorption measurement module are necessary. The measured P6C concentrations in urine are comparable to the published LC‐MS/MS methods (Table S1). All patients tested in this study were treated with pyridoxine and some additionally with a lysine‐restricted diet, but the difference between determined control and patient urine P6C concentrations was statistically highly significant. Nevertheless, before this method can be used in clinical laboratories more data from healthy children below 3 months of age are necessary.'),\n",

The oABA‐based method for trapping and quantifying P6C before the start of therapeutic interventions might be even easier considering that P6C and AASA concentrations are significantly higher in untreated individuals.5, 6, 8 Recently, a novel biomarker for ATQ‐deficient patients was published, and indeed this offered better stability compared to P6C and AASA. However, the quantification method for this is still based on LC‐MS/MS.20\\n\\n\\nWe only tested frozen urine samples and can only hypothesize that fresh urine samples from ATQ‐deficient patients and healthy controls might recapitulate the data. Yuzyuk et al7 reported a mean loss of 18% AASA/P6C signal using LC‐MS/MS after storage of urine for 120\\u2009hours at 4°C. Similar data were described using one ATQ‐deficiency urine sample.8 Therefore, if shipment of urine at 4°C is necessary but lasts less than a few days, the oABA condensation method might work. Nevertheless, this must be rigorously tested, because the background might increase. Alternatively, immediate addition of oABA might stabilise CHHPQ. Acidification of urine to pH 3 to 5, the optimal condition for oABA‐based condensation of delta‐1‐pyrroline or delta‐1‐piperideine, should be also tested.\\n\\nIt is critical that the P6C standard is stored at sufficiently low temperatures (below −70°C) and freshly prepared at appropriate intervals. A suitable commercial source of high‐quality P6C would be highly advantageous for clinical laboratories with limited chemistry expertise.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nIt is tempting to speculate that the quantification of P6C in plasma using oABA condensation might also be possible prior to starting treatment, and therefore our method might be suitable for newborn screening using urine and plasma. After the start of pyridoxine treatment, the concentration of free P6C and free AASA in plasma is significantly lower and therefore our method is not suitable for plasma P6C quantification. The Knoevenagel‐type condensation of PLP and P6C efficiently blocks absorption and fluorescence in vitro and possibly also in plasma. Farrant wrote that delta‐1‐pyrroline‐5‐carboxylic acid also condenses with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and ketones in vitro and P6C might do the same in vitro as well as in plasma. Therefore, we were surprised by some relatively high concentrations of P6C and AASA measured in plasma samples considering that AASA is a reactive aldehyde interacting with amino groups of proteins, and P6C might also interact with aldehydes and ketones. Nevertheless, P6C might already be efficiently trapped by PLP inside cells, where the PLP concentration is possibly much higher compared to plasma, even in most ATQ‐deficient patients. Our data suggest that mainly the PLP‐complexed form of P6C, or other P6C complexes, appear to be present in plasma. Median plasma PLP concentrations in healthy volunteers vs ATQ‐deficient patients are 72 and 779\\u2009nM, respectively,21 and in most ATQ individuals PLP per se will not interfere in the assay. The white blood cell intracellular concentration of PLP in healthy individuals is in the 10 to 50\\u2009μM range and is possibly 5 to 10‐fold increased in ATQ patients under high dose PLP treatment.22 Therefore, Knoevenagel‐type condensation reactions are more likely to happen inside cells. Nevertheless, it is possible that PLP interferes with oABA‐P6C condensation in plasma, although we do not consider this likely, because in most ATQ patients, PLP concentrations are below 1 μM. Is it possible that LC‐MS/MS‐based methods dissociate the Knoevenagel condensate or other complexes of aldehyde or ketones with P6C/AASA and thereby measure higher AASA/P6C concentrations?'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Ortho‐aminobenzaldehyde‐based quantification in urine and plasma might be significantly improved using liquid chromatography before absorption and fluorescence measurements, but then some of this assay's simplicity would be lost. It might also be possible to increase absorption and fluorescence using oABA derivatives, which are still undergoing efficient fusion with P6C but show higher extinction coefficients and quantum yields.23\\n\\n\\nThe elevated urinary AASA concentrations measured in molybdenum cofactor and sulphate oxidase deficiency might also be readily measurable using the oABA‐based quantification.8, 24\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Flynn et al25 measured plasma and urine concentrations of delta‐1‐pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate (P5C) in Type II hyperprolinaemia patients, a rare disorder which presents with seizures, particularly during febrile illnesses.16, 26 Normal plasma values of P5C are in the 1 μM range using recombinant P5C reductase from E. coli for quantification.27 The mean (SD) P5C plasma concentration in five Type II hyperprolinaemia patients was 22 (5.5) μM. The baseline P5C concentration will also be measured using the oABA‐based method and therefore contributes to the oABA signal generated in healthy volunteers, but oABA/P6C‐based condensation might also detect Type II hyperprolinaemia in children with seizures of unknown cause. The extinction coefficient of the oABA/P5C condensation product is approximately 2400 and is similar to P6C.28, 29 Interestingly, Flynn et al.25 used an assay for quantification of P5C in urine based on oABA condensation, and reported that using urine the mean optical density value for control subjects was 0.01325 (n = 20). The mean optical density values for nine Type II hyperprolinaemia patients were massively elevated and ranged from 0.053 to 1.677, the latter number implying a urinary P5C concentration of 700\\u2009μM. The assay conditions were not described and therefore we cannot compare the data to the methods used in this study. Applegarth et al26 published a case report of Type II hyperprolinaemia with similar high urinary absorption data using oABA. Both the Flynn et al25 and Applegarth et al26 data strongly support the oABA‐based quantification method of P6C using urine from ATQ‐deficient patients.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5 CONCLUSION\\nIdentification of ATQ deficiency and other rare diseases with elevated concentrations of P6C or P5C might be accomplished simply by adding oABA and matrix control to urine samples followed by sensitive absorption measurements. This method can easily be implemented in most clinical chemistry laboratories worldwide and might help to identify these potentially devastating diseases as early as possible. It is tempting to speculate that the clinical efficacy of new therapeutic interventions, such as the inhibition of upstream enzymes to reduce AASA/P6C concentrations, or ultimately even enzyme replacement therapies, might be evaluated in clinical trials with this simple, robust and inexpensive quantification of P6C and P5C using a chemical condensation reaction described more than 80\\u2009years ago.\\n\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\\nThe authors declare no potential conflict of interest.\\n\\nAUTHORS CONTRIBUTIONS\\nTB designed the experiments, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.

Proteomics can be used to assess quantitative changes in protein levels and identify proteins involved in the molecular pathways responsible for cellular differentiation. Using the well-established in vitro BBB model developed in our laboratory, we performed a differential nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS study of Triton X-100-soluble protein species from bovine BCECs displaying either limited BBB functions or BBB functions re-induced by glial cells. Due to the heterogeneity of the crude extract, we increased identification yields by applying a repeatable, reproducible fractionation process based on the proteins' relative hydrophobicity. We present proteomic and biochemical evidence to show that tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and Eps15 homology domain-containing protein 1(EDH1) are over-expressed by bovine BCECs after the re-induction of BBB properties. We discuss the impact of these findings on current knowledge of endothelial and BBB permeability.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nIntroduction\\nOver the last decade, it has become clear that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a role in a large number of diseases. The BBB is now considered to be an active partner or prime participant [1], [2] (rather than a passive target) in diseases such as obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain cancer and diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic research has identified three distinct aspects, depending on the disease in question: (i) selective, transient disruption of the BBB, (ii) the ability to enable a drug to cross the BBB and, in contrast, (iii) the need to stop BBB leakage [3], [4].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The morphology and functional properties of the brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) that form (with other cells) the BBB are now well documented: a decrease in endothelial permeability, fewer caveolae, the reinforcement of tight junctions, fewer pinocytic vesicles, an increase in the number of mitochondria and a higher transendothelial electrical resistance [5], [6]. Large-scale, directed genomics studies (based on comparative analyses of gene expression catalogues or suppression subtractive hybridization) have provided information on tissue-specific gene expression patterns [7]–[12]. A genomic comparison of in vivo and in vitro brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) that de-differentiate in culture yielded a functionally diverse set of 10 genes, the expression of which correlated with a barrier phenotype [13]. Recently, a comparative in vivo analysis of the transcription of more than 85 BBB-associated genes showed an overlap in the normal in situ expression of these genes along the cerebral vascular tree [14]. Nevertheless, cerebral capillaries preferentially express a number of solute-transport-related genes, whereas cerebral venules tend to express inflammation-related genes. Quantitative PCR profiling of RNA samples from laser capture microdissected microvessels revealed that five membrane protein transcripts (out of 30 selected transcripts) were BBB-specific [15]. Identification of membrane proteins expressed in BBBs could help us to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the barrier's function. Furthermore, selectively expressed proteins may be targets for BBB-related therapeutics.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Concomitantly, recent progress in large-scale and/or differential identification proteomics techniques has generated information on the molecular features of the BCECs [16]–[22]. The quantification of around 30 mouse plasma membrane proteins was reported in 2008 [23]. This study was followed by the quantitative identification of 114 plasma membrane proteins (transporters and receptors) from human brain microvessels [24].\\n\\nHowever, although several glial-produced inductive factors or cellular signalling pathways have been identified in the crosstalk between glial cells and BCECs, the fundamental molecular mechanisms that underlie the establishment and maintenance of this phenotype within BCECs remain misunderstood. Crosstalk between BCECs and astrocytes was long time regarded as the main cellular influence on induction of a BBB phenotype; but, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that integrated brain function and dysfunction arise from complex interactions between many different cell types [25], [26].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In order to gain a deeper understanding of BBB-related molecular features, we initiated a non-directed, comparative proteomics approach in order to identify proteins potentially involved in the establishment and maintenance of barrier function in the in vitro model developed in our laboratory. The complexity of the crude extract of Triton X-100 solubilized proteins from BCECs prevented efficient mass spectrometry (MS) fragmentation analysis and thus the identification of individual proteins. We therefore decided to apply a fractionation process based on the proteins\\' relative hydrophobicity [22] and demonstrated its repeatability and reproducibility (data not shown). A comparative, off-line, nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis enabled the identification of 436 and 408 proteins in bovine BCECs with limited BBB functions (\"Lim. BBB\", after solo-culture) and re-induced BBB functions (\"Re-ind. BBB\", after co-culture with glial cells), respectively. Eleven of these (ranging from proteins associated with assembly and organization of the cytoskeleton [21] to those involved in vesicular transport and nucleic acid binding) appeared to be more abundantly in the cytoplasm of Re-ind. BBB cells. We present proteomic and biochemical evidence to suggest that tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and Eps15 homology domain-containing protein 1 (EHD1) are over-expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in Re-ind. BBB cells and that this over-expression is accompanied by an increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzymatic activity detected in the cells. Moreover, we found that endothelial permeability was significantly greater when AP activity was specifically inhibited with levamisole - suggesting that TNAP is involved in the regulation of endothelial permeability.'),\n",

BBB culture conditions were each fractionated into five sub-fractions (F0, F25, F50, F75 and F100) with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively). Briefly, protein pellets were vigorously vortexed at room temperature during 1 h in a pure H2O solution and centrifuged 5 min at 14000×g. The withdrawn supernatant then constitutes the fraction F0. This is repeated with a solution of 25% H20/75% acetonitrile (v:v) and so on. The fractions were then subjected to trypsin digestion and the peptide were separated on an U3000 nano-LC system (Dionex-LC-Packings, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). After a standard pre-concentration step (C18 cartridge, 300 µm, 1 mm), the peptide samples were separated on a Acclaim PepMap100, C18 column (75 µm i.d. ×15 cm, 3 µm, 100 Å) using an acetonitrile gradient (from 5% to 18.5% acetonitrile over 20 min, from 18.5% to 63.5% over 140 min, from 63.5% to 86% over 15 min and then 15 min in 86% acetonitrile). The flow was set to 300 nl/min and a total of 380 fractions were automatically collected (one every 30 s) on an AnchorChip™ 600 MALDI target by using a Proteineer™ fraction collector (Bruker Daltonics). Matrix (1.8 µl of 0.33 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone: ethanol: 0.1% TFA, 3∶6: 1 v/v/v) was added to each deposit during the collection process. The MS (reflectron mode) and MS/MS (lift mode) measurements were performed off-line in automatic mode on an Ultraflex™ II TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) running FlexControl™ 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). External calibration over the 1,000–3,500 mass range was performed using the [M+H]+ mono-isotopic ions from bradykinin 1–7, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, substance P, bombesin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (clips 1–17 and clips 18–39) from a peptide calibration standard kit (Bruker Daltonics). Briefly, each MS spectrum was acquired by accumulating data from 500 laser shots with a 25 kV accelerating voltage, a 26.3 kV reflector voltage and a 160 ns pulsed ion extraction. Peptide fragmentation was driven by Warp LC software 1.1 (Bruker Daltonics), according to the following parameters: signal-to-noise ratio >15, more than 3 MS/MS per spot if the MS signal was available, 0.15 Da of MS tolerance for peak merge and the elimination of peaks that appeared in over 35% of the fractions. Precursor ions were accelerated to 8 kV and selected in a timed ion gate. Metastable ions generated by laser-induced decomposition were further accelerated by 19 kV in the lift cell and their masses were measured in reflectron mode. For precursor and daughter ions, each MS/MS spectrum was produced by accumulating data from 200 and 1,000 laser shots, respectively. Peak lists were generated from MS and MS/MS spectra using Flexanalysis™ 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). Proteins were identified on the basis of peptide fragmentation fingerprints, according to published guidelines [32]. Database searches with Mascot 2.2 (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) were performed in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 57.13 database via ProteinScape 1.3 (Bruker Daltonics). The mass tolerance was set to 75 ppm for the precursor ions and 0.5 Da for the fragment ions. One missing cleavage site was allowed and variable methionine oxidation was also considered. The relevance of protein identities was judged according to the probability-based molecular weight search score [33] (calculated with p<0.05). The false discovery rate was calculated with the decoy option of the Mascot search engine.

Transendothelial permeability was then assessed by measuring the kinetics of clearance of 50 µM Lucifer Yellow (LY) dilithium from the luminal compartment [30]. The transport of LY across the BCECs monolayer was expressed as a permeability coefficient (PeLY, in cm/min). The AP activity was quantified with an Alkaline Phosphatase Colorimetric Assay Kit (Abcam). Endothelial cell death was assessed using the CytoTox-ONE™ Membrane Integrity Assay (Promega Corporation, USA).

Around 12,000 compounds were detected by MS over the 3 h chromatography run. Unfortunately, the complexity of the samples abolished effective MS/MS fragmentation and only a few proteins were identified (data not shown). The crude extract was therefore divided into the five fractions F0, F25, F50, F75 and F100. As expected on the basis of previous reports [22], the 100% acetonitrile fraction primarily contained the ten major cytoskeletal proteins and was not studied further.\\n\\nAssessment of Protein Fractionation\\nA triplicate protein assay was performed on fractions F0 to F75.

Moreover, the separation profiles for a given fraction were similar under Lim. BBB and Re-ind. BBB conditions. We also observed a lower amount of high-molecular-mass proteins in fraction F25.\\n\\nOverall Evaluation of Protein Identities\\nAfter in-solution proteolysis, each fraction was then subjected to a nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis.

       " Document(page_content='Levamisole-mediated Inhibition\\nThe influence of TNAP activity on endothelial permeability was investigated by applying the uncompetitive AP inhibitor levamisole [41]. Briefly, Lim. BBB and Re-ind. BBB BCECs were separately incubated for 4 h in culture medium supplemented with 0 mM (control), 1 mM and 5 mM levamisole. A lactate-dehydrogenase-based cytotoxicity activity showed that even the highest concentration of levamisole did not significantly induce cell death during this incubation period (Fig. 4C). The AP assay revealed a dose-dependent decrease in phosphate hydrolysis (Fig. 4A), which reached 95% in Lim. BBB and 86% in Re-ind. BBB BCECs when exposed to 5 mM levamisole. Interestingly, the endothelial monolayer permeability (Fig. 4B) was unaffected at levamisole concentrations of 1 mM, whereas a concentration of 5 mM provoked a 4- fold increase in endothelial permeability in Lim. BBB BCECs but not in Re-ind. BBB BCECs. This result suggests that TNAP protects against the permeability increase mediated by levamisole.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nAlthough marked progress has been made over the last decade, the process by which BCECs differentiate to obtain the BBB phenotype is poorly documented in molecular terms. In order to gain a deeper understanding of BBB-related molecular features, we have been applying a range of proteomic tools to our well-characterized in vitro BBB model for the last few years. We are particularly seeking to describe the protein abundance changes that occur during the glial cell-driven re-induction of the BBB phenotype in BCECs.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In proteomics, crude extracts of cell proteins are challenging for many reasons: the features of the extracted cell types, the varying abundances of proteins in a cell and the particular properties of hydrophobic proteins. Under these conditions, shotgun approaches can show their limits. We showed that the heterogeneity of a crude Triton X-100-soluble protein extract can be efficiently and reproducibly reduced by organic fractionation before nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis. Ninety percent of the 447 identified proteins were identified in protein extracts from both Lim. BBB and Re-ind. BBB BCECs, the phenotypes of which are thus not completely different.\\n\\nIn this differential proteomics study with biochemical and immunological confirmation, we generated evidence to show that TNAP was overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in Re-ind. BBB BCECs and that the increase in TNAP enzymatic activity was correlated with protein levels. The AP family (EC. 3.1.3.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters to produce inorganic phosphate and an alcohol from a variety of organic compounds: nucleosides (5′ -tri-, -di- and -mono- phosphates), pyrophosphate inorganic, pyridoxal-5‘-phosphate and phosphorylated proteins [42], [43]. Hence, the APs can control not only cellular ectonucleosidase and protein dephosphorylation activities but also bone mineralization. Notably, astrocytes release ATP and other nucleotides [44]. The APs are dimeric isoenzymes that are bound to the extracellular surface of plasma membrane microdomains by glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. In mammalian cells, four isoenzymes have been described and named according to the tissue specificity (or not) of their expression: intestinal alkaline phosphatase, placental alkaline phosphatase, germ cell alkaline phosphatase and liver-type, bone-type or kidney-type TNAP. Expression of the TNAP types depends on alternative transcription initiation processes but results in the same amino acid sequence [45].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Most of the AP expression data in nervous tissue relate to combined enzyme assays and histological studies. The general presence of AP activity in the brain was reported some time ago [46]–[48] but more precise reports concerning the cerebral parenchyma and the BCECs are more recent [49]–[51]. This characteristic was also noted in several in vitro models of mammalian BBBs [52]–[54]. Alkaline phosphatase activity has long been used as a brain endothelium marker [55], [56]. In fact, TNAP is the only AP isoform found in the brain [57], [58]. It has been suggested that BCEC maturation during brain development is corroborated with high TNAP activity [59]. Beck et al. [60] first mentioned that TNAP activity was markedly elevated when the ECs were co-cultured with glial cells. This fact was recently confirmed [61] by a study showing that bone-type TNAP is present in neurons and brain ECs in several species. The study also revealed strongly down-regulated expression of the bone TNAP transcript when mouse BCECs were maintained in solo-culture for a few days [61]. Interestingly, a variety of molecules are known to modulate AP expression (retinoic acid [62]–[64]; cAMP [65]; glucocorticoids [62], [66]; transforming growth factor-beta [53]; IL-6 [53] and basic fibroblast growth factor [54], [67]) and brain capillary endothelial permeability. In the present study, we found that glial-cell-induced TNAP expression prevented a levamisole-induced increase in endothelial permeability - suggesting a protective effect.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The best-investigated function of TNAP is its involvement in bone mineralization and remodeling [68], although this appears to be out of the scope of the BBB field. However, there are several lines of evidence in favor of an important role for TNAP in brain function. Hypophosphatasia is one of several brain diseases that are related (at least in part) to the BBB [69], [70]. It results from various mutations of the TNAP gene and is associated with neurological disorders such as mental retardation, seizures and epilepsy [71]–[73]. Furthermore, TNAP is thought to be involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and the availability of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) in the brain [74]. We hypothesize that TNAP may regulate the extracellular concentration of PLP through dephosphorylation, thus allowing pyridoxine (the dephosphorylated form of PLP) to cross the BBB [75]. Interestingly, alimentary B1 avitaminosis reportedly produces a decline in AP activity in the rat brain [76]. Moreover, an alimentary deficiency of vitamin B6 (a precursor of PLP) promotes epileptic seizures (as observed in TNAP −/− mice) – seizures that can be suppressed by administration of the vitamin [77], [78]. This co-factor is involved in many different reactions (such as the decarboxylation of amino acids) in the production of a variety of molecules, ranging from neurotransmitters to polyamines [79].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"It was recently reported that TNAP (in concert with the ionotrophic P2X7 ATP receptor) promotes axonal growth of hippocampal neurons by regulating (via its ectonucleosidase activity) the extracellular ATP concentration [80]. In vitro, TNAP promotes the neurotoxic effect of extracellular Tau protein [81]. In vivo, TNAP activity is found to be elevated in the hippocampus of patients with AD [82]. Since TNAP promotes the expression of the BBB phenotype in BCECs, one can legitimately suppose that reducing the BBB permeability can enhance Tau-mediated brain lesions by reducing cerebral clearance of the Tau protein.\\n\\nDespite its known phosphomonoesterase activity, TNAP's putative ability to dephosphorylate protein targets remains subject to debate. Direct proof of TNAP's action on the phosphorylation state of lamini has been reported [58] but contrasts with evidence to show that TNAP does not modulate the phosphorylation of plasma membrane proteins [83]. A differential proteomics study investigating the phosphoprotein changes that occur in Lim. BBB and Re-ind. BBB BCECs would probably provide valuable information on how the BBB phenotype is established.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nSeveral researchers have suggested that AP is associated with transport systems [84] in general and organic cation transport in particular [85]–[87]. Here, we found significant, differential expression of the EHD1 at the mRNA transcript and protein levels. The protein is the most extensively studied member (and the archetype) of the Eps15 homology domain (EHD)-containing family. The latter co-controls the endocytic recycling and transport of receptors internalized through clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways [88]. More specifically, EHD1 is a serum-inducible serine phosphoprotein [89] that is many found in the endocytic recycling compartment [90]. In fact, EHD1 is thought to co-regulate the exit of a wide range of proteins (including the transferrin receptor (TfR) [91], the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator [92], the major histocompatibility complex class I [93], integrin β1 [94], the glucose transporter type 4 [95]) from this compartment to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the TfR is specifically expressed on the luminal side of BCECs [96] and levels increase in co-culture with glial cells [97]. Indeed, the TfR is at the heart of efforts seeking to deliver drugs to the brain (see [98] for a review). Given that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes lack TfR, these cells could influence iron import by the BCECs [99]. Synthesis of the TfR is regulated at the mRNA level by five iron-responsive elements present in untranslated mRNA regions, leading to the overexpression of the TfR in iron-depleted situations. However, low extracellular iron levels do not prompt greater TfR expression in BCECs, despite considerably higher blood-to-brain iron transport [100]. This observation suggests that iron depletion raises the recycling rate for endosomes containing TfRs. Although the nature of iron transport across BCECs remains subject to debate (with either receptor-mediated endocytosis or receptor-mediated transcytosis; see [99], [101] for a review), it is clear that iron is indeed transported from the blood to the brain and this transport begins by endocytosis of the iron-lactoferrin-TfR complex (after which TfR would recycled to the plasma membrane). Therefore, EHD1 overexpression in Re-ind. BBB BCECs may constitute indirect evidence of faster recycling TfR. Likewise, glucose transporter type 4 and integrin β1 are expressed by the BBB endothelium [102], [103].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='It is known that EHD1 can bind directly to a variety of phospholipids [104], [105] and regulate cell cholesterol homeostasis - suggesting its involvement in low density lipoprotein-receptor (LRP1) internalization [106]. LRP1-mediated endocytosis has also been mentioned in connection with the internalization of various molecules at the BBB endothelium. Several other proteins also interact with EHD1, including rabenosyn-5, EH-binding protein 1, syndapins I and II and rab11 family-interacting protein 2 (see [107] for a review).\\n\\nEHD1 also regulates actin dynamics by interacting with the Rho-family members GTPase Rac 1 and cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) [108], [109]. We have already reported quantitative changes in levels of actin-related proteins in BCECs displaying BBB features [21], [110].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Conclusion\\nFor the first time, we used our novel fractionation method [22] to perform a differential analysis of Triton X-100-soluble proteins extracted from Lim. BBB and Re-ind. BBB BCECs. We demonstrated that the fractionation method was reliable and reproducible. The proteins highlighted by proteomics were validated by biochemical techniques. We identified 11 proteins (notably including TNAP and EHD1) that were overexpressed in Re-ind. BBB BCECs. The overexpression of TNAP and EHD1 was confirmed by RT-PCR, immunoblotting and (for TNAP) an AP assay, thus corroborating previous studies. Our initial results for EDH1 overexpression suggest that endocytic recycling and transport is probably accelerated in ECs with a barrier phenotype. Various lines of evidence indicate that TNAP is involved in the transport of pyridoxine across the BBB and the compound's subsequent use in neurotransmitter metabolism. We also demonstrated that glial-cell-induced TNAP overexpression prevents the increase in endothelial permeability otherwise induced by the uncompetitive AP inhibitor levamisole. This finding suggests that TNAP may be an important component in the establishment and maintenance of the BBB phenotype in BCECs. However, the nature of TNAP actions (i.e. ectonucleosidase or phosphatase activities or both) and the mechanism underlying the enzyme's involvement in the glial-cell-induced process remain to be determined.\\n\\nSupporting Information\\nTable S1 \\nDNA primers and conditions used to amplify mRNA.\\n\\n\\n(XLSX)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.\\n\\n We thank Dr F.

Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is essential for maintaining phosphate homeostasis and is mainly produced by osteocytes. FGF23 increases the excretion of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and decreases the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidneys. Osteocytes are cells of osteoblastic lineage that have undergone terminal differentiation and become embedded in mineralized bone matrix. Osteocytes express FGF23 and other multiple genes responsible for hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which include phosphate-regulating gene homologous to endopeptidase on X chromosome (PHEX), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), and family with sequence similarity 20, member C (FAM20C). Since inactivating mutations in PHEX, DMP1, and FAM20C boost the production of FGF23, these molecules might be considered as local negative regulators of FGF23. Mouse studies have suggested that enhanced FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling is involved in the overproduction of FGF23 in PHEX-deficient X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) and DMP1-deficient autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 1. Since FGFR is involved in the transduction of signals evoked by extracellular Pi, Pi sensing in osteocytes may be abnormal in these diseases. Serum levels of sclerostin, an inhibitor Wnt/β-catenin signaling secreted by osteocytes, are increased in XLH patients, and mouse studies have suggested the potential of inhibiting sclerostin as a new therapeutic option for the disease. The elucidation of complex abnormalities in the osteocytes of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases will provide a more detailed understanding of their pathogenesis and more effective treatments.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmcIntroduction\\n\\nIn human adults, approximately 90% of total phosphorus in the body is stored in the skeleton as calcium/phosphate crystals, such as hydroxyapatite. Most of the remaining phosphorus exists in soft tissues, and less than 1% is distributed in extracellular fluid (ECF). Phosphorus is present as inorganic phosphate (Pi) in serum (1). Since Pi is indispensable for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite, its prolonged deficiency or wasting impairs skeletal mineralization (2).\\n\\nFibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced in bone and increases renal Pi excretion by down-regulating the expression of type IIa and IIc sodium/Pi (Na+/Pi) co-transporters (NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc, respectively) (3). FGF23 also down-regulates the expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α hydroxylase and up-regulates that of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24 hydroxylase, reducing the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) (3). The excessive effects of FGF23 result in hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia, which is characterized by renal Pi wasting, hypophosphatemia, inappropriately normal or low levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D (4). FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases include various genetic conditions, such as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH, MIM #307800), autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR, MIM #193100), autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets 1 (ARHR1, MIM #241520), ARHR2 (MIM #613312), and Raine syndrome (RNS, MIM #259775) (4).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Osteocytes are dendritic-shaped cells that terminally differentiate from a subpopulation of matrix-producing osteoblasts (5). They reside in lacunae, small cavities surrounded by a mineralized bone matrix, and communicate with other osteocytes and cells on bone surface including osteoblasts, by their long processes in canaliculi. Although research on their function has been hindered because of their location and inaccessibility, scientific advances in the past few decades have revealed that osteocytes play critical roles in the bone homeostasis and the regulation of Pi metabolism (5). The identification and characterization of the human osteocytic genes responsible for rare skeletal diseases have contributed to a more detailed understanding of osteocyte function. SOST was identified as the causative gene for sclerosteosis 1 (MIM #269500) and van Buchem disease (MIM #239100), which are characterized by a high bone mass, indicating that osteocytes regulate bone mass by producing sclerostin (6, 7). In addition to FGF23, several causative genes for hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are highly expressed in osteocytes. Among them are the phosphate-regulating gene homologous to endopeptidase on X chromosome (PHEX), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), and family with sequence similarity 20, member C (FAM20C). Inactivating mutations in these genes cause hypophosphatemia and impaired skeletal mineralization by increasing the production of FGF23 in osteocytes (8).\\n\\nThis article aims to summarize and discuss the current knowledge on the roles of osteocytes in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemic rickets.\\n\\nPi homeostasis and FGF23'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Pi homeostasis is mainly maintained by the balance between its absorption in the intestines, excretion from the kidneys, and deposition in and mobilization from bone and involves endocrine factors, such as 1,25(OH)2D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and FGF23 (1). 1,25(OH)2D increases intestinal Pi absorption by up-regulating the expression of type IIb Na+/Pi co-transporter NaPi-IIb (1, 9). PTH increases Pi excretion by reducing the abundance of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc in the brush border membrane of proximal tubules (1, 9). FGF23, whose main source are the osteocytes in bone, down-regulates the renal expression of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc to increase Pi excretion and lower serum Pi levels. FGF23 also decreases the production of 1,25(OH)2D, which reduces intestinal Pi absorption and further lowers serum Pi levels (3).\\n\\nBioactive intact FGF23 is cleaved to be inactivated between Arg179 and Ser180 by a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (10). The O-glycosylation of Thr178 in FGF23 prevents the cleavage-mediated inactivation of FGF23 (11). Intact FGF23 assays utilize two antibodies against the N- and C-terminal segments of the cleavage site and capture only bioactive intact proteins (12). On the other hand, C-terminal assays use antibodies against the C-terminal segments of the cleavage site, and detect both the intact protein and cleaved C-terminal fragments of FGF23 (13). FGF23 at physiological concentrations requires αKlotho as a cofactor to exert signals through FGF receptors (FGFR) in its distant target organs (14, 15).\\n\\nOsteocytes and bone homeostasis'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the adult skeleton, osteocytes represent more than 90% of all bone cells (5). They control bone mass by producing sclerostin encoded by the SOST gene. Sclerostin inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6 (16). Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays important roles in bone homeostasis: the activation of this pathway facilitates the commitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells to the osteoblast lineage and promotes the proliferation and differentiation of committed osteoblasts (17, 18). In addition, this pathway suppresses the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts by reducing the expression ratio of receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) to osteoprotegerin in osteoblast lineage cells (17). A sclerostin deficiency due to inactivating variants and a large deletion in the regulatory sequence of the SOST gene cause sclerosteosis 1 and van Buchem disease, respectively, which are characterized by osteosclerosis and a high bone mass (6, 7). Mechanical force and PTH suppress the expression of sclerostin/SOST in osteocytes, leading to enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and an increased bone mass (19–22).\\n\\nInhibition of sclerostin provides a bone anabolic treatment for bone diseases with a low bone mass. The anti-sclerostin antibody romosozumab is widely used to treat patients with osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture (23). A randomized phase 2a trial on adult patients with moderate osteogenesis imperfecta demonstrated that treatment with the anti-sclerostin antibody BPS804 increased the areal bone mineral density of the lumber spine by stimulating bone formation and reducing bone resorption (24).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='RANKL, which plays an essential role in osteoclastogenesis and the activation of osteoclasts, is expressed in osteocytes and osteoblasts. The conditional deletion of RANKL from osteocytes in mice resulted in a progressive osteopetrotic phenotype after birth (25, 26), and studies using several Cre drivers suggested that osteocyte-derived RANKL, rather than osteoblast-derived RANKL, plays a major role in bone remodeling (27). Osteocyte-derived RANKL is up-regulated by aging and may be involved in the aging-related loss of cortical bone (28). Therefore, osteocytes are essential in the regulation of both bone formation and resorption.\\n\\nOsteocytes and the pathogenesis of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets\\n\\nFGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia\\n\\nDisorders associated with the excessive effects of FGF23 manifest hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia characterized by renal Pi wasting and inappropriately normal or low levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D, and are collectively called FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia (4). This includes various conditions such as tumor-induced osteomalacia caused by the overproduction of FGF23 due to phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors, hypophosphatemia associated with the intravenous administration of iron preparations, and genetic disorders, such as ADHR, XLH, ARHR1, ARHR2, and RNS (4).\\n\\nADHR and osteocytes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ADHR is caused by missense mutations at the Arg176 or Arg179 residues within the RXXR/S motif of FGF23, which is recognized by subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (29, 30). Although these mutations are expected to confer resistance to the cleavage-mediated inactivation of FGF23, ADHR shows incomplete penetrance (31). The delayed onset of ADHR generally manifests in females after puberty, and an iron deficiency has been suggested to drive increases in serum FGF23 levels and manifestation of the disease (32). The iron status modified the plasma levels of intact and C-terminal fragments of FGF23 differently in ADHR patients and healthy subjects (32). In animal studies, a low-iron diet caused hypophosphatemia in ADHR model mice carrying FGF23[p.R179Q] mutation, along with increased serum levels of both intact FGF23 and C-terminal fragments. On the other hand, wild-type mice on a low-iron diet showed normal intact FGF23 levels and normophosphatemia despite elevated C-terminal FGF23 levels (33). In vitro experiments using an iron chelator have suggested that an iron deficiency up-regulates the expression of Fgf23 in osteoblastic cells via the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (33). These findings suggest that, in an iron deficiency, the wild-type FGF23 protein is excessively inactivated by proteolytic cleavage to maintain normal serum Pi levels, whereas the impaired cleavage of FGF23 with an ADHR mutation increases bioactive FGF23 levels and promotes hypophosphatemia. Therefore, sensing of the iron status by osteocytes appears to be a critical step for the onset of ADHR.\\n\\nXLH and osteocytes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='XLH and osteocytes\\n\\nXLH is the most common form of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and is caused by inactivating mutations in the PHEX gene (34). XLH patients have elevated serum levels of intact FGF23, resulting in renal Pi wasting, hypophosphatemia, and low to inappropriately normal levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D (35). Pediatric patients may manifest rickets, bone deformities, and a short stature, while adult patients may show osteomalacia, fractures, pseudo-fractures, enthesopathies (pathological changes in the insertion of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules), osteoarthritis, hearing loss, and hyperparathyroidism (35). To date, more than 1000 PHEX mutations have been identified to be responsible for XLH (https://www.rarediseasegenes.com/).\\n\\nSimilar to FGF23, PHEX is expressed in osteoblast lineage cells with higher expression in osteocytes (8). Hypomineralized periosteocytic lesions are unique features in the bones of XLH patients, indicating abnormal osteocyte functions (36). Hypophosphatemic Hyp mice, which carry a large deletion in the Phex gene, reproduce elevated FGF23 levels and hypophosphatemia and are widely used as a murine model for XLH (37, 38). The conditional ablation of the Phex gene from osteoblasts and osteocytes using Cre recombinase driven by the Osteocalcin promoter resulted in an almost identical phenotype to that of Hyp mice, suggesting that impaired PHEX functions in osteoblasts and/or osteocytes alone are sufficient to cause the disease (39).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The PHEX protein is suggested to function as a cell surface-bound, zinc-dependent protease based on its structure (40): however, its precise physiological roles and the mechanisms by which its deficiency increases FGF23 levels remain elusive. Although there is no clear relationship between the PHEX genotype and clinical phenotype (41), a recent study using 3-dimensional modeling has suggested that serum FGF23 levels are higher in patients whose PHEX mutations affect the zinc-binding site or the cavity of the protein (42). Thus, these regions may be important for PHEX function to regulate FGF23.\\n\\nMatrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) belongs to the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoproteins) family. PHEX binds to MEPE via the acidic serine-aspartate rich MEPE-associated motif (ASARM) located at the C-terminal region of MEPE, immediately downstream of cathepsin B recognition site (43). ASARM peptides produced by proteolytic cleavage of MEPE inhibit mineralization (44). Serum levels of ASARM peptides are increased in Hyp mice, implicating that they are degraded by PHEX and that their accumulation might be involved in the defective skeletal mineralization in PHEX deficiency (45).\\n\\nThe ASARM motif is shared in other members of SIBLINGs family, such as osteopontin (OPN) and DMP1 (46). Synthesized OPN-ASARM peptides inhibited in vitro mineralization of osteoblasts by binding to hydroxyapatite, and addition of recombinant PHEX protein rescued this inhibition of mineralization (46). OPN is highly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes and can be a candidate of protein substrate for PHEX (47). A recent study demonstrated that the genetic ablation of OPN in Hyp mice partially rescued impaired skeletal mineralization without correcting hypophosphatemia (48), suggesting the involvement of OPN in the pathogenesis of XLH.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='FGFR signaling is enhanced in Hyp bone (49). Comparisons of gene expression in osteocytes between Hyp mice and wild-type mice revealed marked increases in the osteocytic expression of canonical FGF ligands (Fgf1 and Fgf2), FGF receptors (Fgfr1-3), and early growth response 1, a downstream target for FGFR activation, in Hyp mice (8). Furthermore, the osteocyte-specific deletion of Fgfr1 partially restored the overproduction of FGF23 and ameliorated hypophosphatemia and rickets in Hyp mice (50). These findings suggest a pathogenic role for enhanced FGFR signaling in the overproduction of FGF23 in Phex-deficient osteocytes. This is of interest because previous studies suggested the involvement of FGFR in Pi sensing (1). In various cell types including osteoblasts, a treatment with high Pi activates FGFR to regulate gene expression (51–53). In the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, a treatment with an FGFR inhibitor abolished the up-regulation of Dmp1 by increasing extracellular Pi levels (53). In mice, the Pi-induced activation of FGFR1 up-regulated the Galnt3 expression in bone, resulting in an elevation of serum FGF23 levels (54). Enhanced FGFR signaling in Hyp osteocytes suggests that dysregulated Pi sensing might underlie the pathogenesis of XLH. In Hyp osteocytes, the expression of Dmp1 and Fam20c was also markedly up-regulated, indicating complex abnormalities in Phex-deficient osteocytes (8). Figure\\xa01 shows complex abnormalities in Hyp osteocytes.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure\\xa01 Complex abnormalities in osteocytes of Phex-deficient Hyp mice. In Hyp osteocytes, the expression of Fgfr1 is increased and enhanced FGFR signaling may underlie the overproduction of FGF23. The overproduction of FGF23 leads to the renal wasting of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and impaired vitamin D metabolism. Hyp osteocytes produce an increased amount of sclerostin, which may stimulate the production of FGF23. The production of osteopontin is up-regulated in Hyp osteocytes, which impairs skeletal mineralization. The expression of Dmp1 and Fam20c is also increased.\\n\\nARHR1 and osteocytes\\n\\nARHR1 is caused by inactivating mutations in the DMP1 gene, which encodes an extracellular matrix protein belonging to the SIBLINGs family (55, 56). DMP1 is predominantly expressed in osteocytes and odontoblasts. Dmp1-null mice show phenotypes reproducing the clinical manifestation in ARHR1 and exhibit defective osteocyte maturation, increased FGF23 expression in osteocytes, and impaired skeletal mineralization (56). Similar to Phex-deficient Hyp mice, the activation of the FGFR pathway was suggested to be involved in the increased production of FGF23 in Dmp1-null mice (49). The overproduction of FGF23 may be attributed to enhanced FGFR signaling in osteocytes in both XLH and ARHR1.\\n\\nIt was reported that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of DMP1 in rabbit caused the phenotype similar to human ARHR1, including the elevated serum FGF23 and hypophosphatemic rickets. DMP1-knockout rabbits also exhibited severe defects in bone microarchitecture (57).\\n\\nARHR2 and osteocytes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ARHR2 is caused by inactivating mutations in the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) gene, which encodes an ectoenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) (58–60). PPi inhibits mineralization, and inactivating mutations in ENPP1 cause disorders characterized by ectopic calcification, such as generalized arterial calcification of infancy (60, 61). ENPP1 is expressed in many tissues, and is highly expressed in chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells (62). The mechanisms by which an ENPP1 deficiency leads to the overproduction of FGF23 currently remain elusive. PPi may regulate the FGF23 production: however, patients with hypophosphatasia, the disease caused by inactivating mutations in tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase, have normal FGF23 levels along with elevated PPi levels (63). A recent mouse study demonstrated the increased expression of Fgf23 in the bones of Enpp1-deficient mice, and a negative correlation between Enpp1 and Fgf23 transcription was revealed by dosing Enpp1-deficient mice with ENPP1-Fc recombinant protein (64). These findings suggest that the lack of osteocyte-derived Enpp1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of ARHR2.\\n\\nRNS and osteocytes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='RNS and osteocytes\\n\\nRNS is a disease of autosomal recessive inheritance, and the patients show craniofacial malformation, osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, and a poor prognosis. RNS patients who survive infancy may manifest hypophosphatemia related to FGF23 excess and dental abnormalities (65, 66). The gene responsible for RNS is FAM20C (also called DMP4), which encodes a kinase that phosphorylates various secreted proteins including FGF23 and members of the SIBLING family, such as DMP1 (10, 67, 68). The expression of Fam20c was higher in osteocytes than in osteoblasts, which was similar to the expression pattern of Fgf23, Dmp1 and Phex (8). Wang, et\\xa0al. generated Fam20c conditional knockout mice, in which the gene was globally deleted or specifically inactivated in the mineralized tissues (69). Both mouse lines exhibited hypophosphatemic rickets along with elevated FGF23 levels in serum and bone. They also demonstrated the down-regulation of a number of marker genes in osteoblast/osteocyte lineage cells, which included Dmp1 and osteocalcin (69). Furthermore, knockout of Fam20c in immortalized murine osteoblasts resulted in the up-regulation of Fgf23 and down-regulation of Dmp1 (70). Thus, Fam20c-deficiency may lead to the overproduction of FGF23 in bone through thedown-regulation of the Dmp1 expression and impaired phosphorylation of Dmp1 protein. However, a transgenic overexpression of Dmp1 failed to rescue elevated FGF23 levels and hypophosphatemia of Fam20c knockout mice (71), suggesting the involvement of other mechanisms. Since it was reported that FAM20C phosphorylated FGF23 on Ser180, which prevented the O-glycosylation of FGF23 on Thr178 and accelerated cleavage-mediated inactivation (10),the impaired cleavage of FGF23 due to the reduced phosphorylation of FGF23 on Ser180 may be one of the pathogenesis of elevated intact FGF23 in RNS.\\n\\nOsteocytes as the target to treat FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets'),\n",

A previous study reported that the initiation of conventional therapy in early infancy improved the growth and biochemical and radiological outcomes of pediatric patients with XLH; however, it failed to completely normalize skeletal development (72). Furthermore, conventional therapy did not prevent or attenuate enthesopathies or hearing loss in adult patients (35). Moreover, the administration of oral Pi salts and active vitamin D may cause adverse effects, such as hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism (35).\\n\\nBurosumab, a humanized anti-FGF23 monoclonal antibody, has been approved since 2018 for the treatment of XLH in several countries based on the promising findings of the clinical trials (73–76). The approved indication for burosumab differs among regions/countries; it is approved for patients with TIO in several countries. In Japan, it is approved for all patients with FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia (4).\\n\\nSince FGF23 and sclerostin are both expressed in osteocytes, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they may be related. Serum sclerostin levels were reported to be higher in XLH patients than in healthy controls (77, 78). An in vitro study suggested that sclerostin directly stimulated the production of FGF23 (79). The treatment of Hyp mice with an anti-sclerostin antibody suppressed serum intact FGF23 levels and increased serum Pi levels and bone mass (80, 81), suggesting the potential of inhibiting sclerostin as a treatment option for XLH.\\n\\nConclusion'),\n",

Although the mechanisms by which inactivating mutations in these genes cause the overproduction of FGF23 have not yet been clarified, enhanced FGFR signaling and abnormal Pi sensing might be involved in the pathogenesis of XLH and ARHR1.

       " Document(page_content=\"\\n\\nAs one of the three major renal cell carcinoma histological subtypes, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) accounts for 4%–5% of renal cancer cases [1]. The average diagnostic age of ChRCC is 58 years, and most patients are male [2]. Most patients with ChRCC have good prognoses with 5-year survival rates of 78%–100%. However, metastases still occur in about 6%–7% of patients and usually affect the liver or lungs [3]. Furman et al. and Panel et al.'s tumor classification schemes have already been proposed for use in staging ChRCC over the past decades [4, 5]. However, considering the ambiguity of the grading criteria and the lack of applicability to the characteristics of the nucleus of ChRCC, their prognostic value appears to have been overestimated [6, 7]. In order to better standardize treatment and improve patient prognosis, it is critical to elucidate highly specific biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets. In 2011, Salmena et al. described the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis, which reexplored the regulatory function of long noncoding RNAs and the potential network between messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [8]. As a key element in the ceRNA network, miRNAs could simultaneously be competitively antagonized by lncRNA, mRNA, and other RNAs through shared microRNA response elements (MREs). Overexpressed MRE-containing transcripts (so-called “RNA sponges”) could affect expression by absorbing multiple miRNAs connected to mRNAs [9–11]. This molecular internal regulation mechanism plays an important role in the occurrence and development of multiple cancers [12]. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, established by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, has collected numerous genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data for 33 cancer types [13, 14], facilitating exploration of the ceRNA network in ChRCC and the identification of prognostic-related biomarkers.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"2. Methods\\n\\nAll clinical and RNA sequence profile data of patients enrolled in TCGA database before May 2020, including mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA matrices, were completely downloaded and extracted from the dataset (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). Inclusion criteria stipulated that the clinical data of every sample should, at least, include the patient's survival status and survival time. The R version 3.6.0 software was used for all statistical analyses. As a public database was used, additional approval from an ethics committee was not required.\\n\\nThe “edgeR” package of R (version 3.6.0) was used to elucidate and compare the DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs of normal and cancer samples. Log2FC > 2 and FDR < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We preformed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses using the “clusterProfiler” package (with P < 0.05 as significant) to construct the pathway-gene and pathway-pathway networks [15].\\n\\nAfter verifying and confirming the optimal soft threshold, we conducted weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) using the “WGCNA” package. RNAs were classified into different color modules according to the connectivity and synergy between them. In selecting the RNAs for next analyses, connectivity was established between each module and the relevant ChRCC trait.\\n\\nThe lncRNA-miRNA matrices in selected modules were predicted and simplified in miRcode (http://www.mircode.org/) and their associations obtained. These miRNAs were predicted using StarBase (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/), miRTarBase (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/), miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org/), and TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/) datasets in order to obtain their target mRNAs. The mRNAs from selected modules were combined with the target mRNAs to exclude unrelated mRNAs.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Finally, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed in turn using the “survival” package of R to elucidate the most significant independent risk factor mRNAs associated with the OS of patients with ChRCC. Sample scores were compared to the median risk score and divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. ROC and C-indices were used to evaluate the stability and reliability of the mRNA-based prognostic model. The detailed flow chart is presented in Figure 1.\\n\\nBased on the elucidated relationships between lncRNAs-miRNAs and miRNAs-mRNAs and the Cox results, we were able to derive the lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs competing endogenous network. The Cytoscape software (version of 3.6.1) was used to visualize the ceRNA network. The Kaplan–Meier curves were used to analyze the reliability with which each RNA in the ceRNA network was able to predict the patient's OS (with P < 0.05 indicating significant reliability).\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\nThe lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression matrices of the 89 patients (24 normal and 65 with ChRCC) were downloaded from TCGA dataset. Patients' clinicopathological characteristics are presented in Table 1. The univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions of patients' clinical data revealed that none of those characteristics were significant independent risk factors associated with their OS (Table 2).\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Firstly, 1628 DElncRNAs (763/865, up/down), 104 DEmiRNAs (61/43, up/down), and 2619 DEmRNAs (1103/1516, up-/down-DEmRNAs) were elucidated. Their volcano maps and heatmaps are presented in Figures 2(a)–2(c). GO analysis showed that the top five functions of the 2619 DEmRNAs focused on organic anion transport, regulation of membrane potential, regulation of ion transmembrane transport, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and regulation of transsynaptic signaling (Figure 3(a)). Meanwhile, the top five KEGG pathways of these DEmRNAs were enriched in neuroactive ligand−receptor interaction, cAMP signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, retinol metabolism, and chemical carcinogenesis (Figure 3(b)). Insulin secretion and connection between pathways were presented in the pathway-pathway network (Figure 3(c)). In the pathway-gene network, multiple RNAs were related to five pathways: complement and coagulation cascades, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, neuroactive ligand−receptor interaction, retinol metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis (Figure 3(d)).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the WGCNA, the power of the soft threshold of the lncRNA-miRNA matrix was 10 (Figure 4(a)), and the miRNA-mRNA matrix was 14 (Figure 4(b)), both of which achieved the best satisfaction and consistency of the scale-free R-squared value. After calculating their adjacency and connectivity, these lncRNAs-miRNAs were classified into 10 modules (Figure 4(c)), and miRNAs-mRNAs were classified into 11 modules (Figure 4(d)). Their topological overlap matrix heatmaps are presented in Figures 4(e) and 4(f). Red, yellow, brown, and grey modules of lncRNAs-miRNAs were found to have significant correlation (Figure 5(a)), and greater connections were also observed in green, turquoise, and grey modules of the miRNAs-mRNAs (Figure 5(b)). Modules in these two groups included a total of 1534 DElncRNAs, 98 DEmiRNAs, and 2543 DEmRNAs, which were also more closely related to ChRCC than the others (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)).\\n\\nWhen predicting the DElncRNAs and DEmiRNAs of the module genes in miRcode, we identified 116 DElncRNAs (43/73, up/down) and 19 DEmiRNAs (9/10, up/down) and their connective pairs. When using the StarBase, miRTarBase, miRDB, and TargetScan datasets, 512 target mRNAs of the 19 DEmiRNAs were included. Forty-three of them finally coincided with selected module DEmRNAs (Figure 5(e)), which corresponded to 113 lncRNAs and 14 miRNAs.'),\n",

Moreover, the results of multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions indicted that two of the nine mRNAs (CADM2 and SFRP1) were independent risk factors for ChRCC (Figure 6(a)). The C-index of this model was 0.91, and the 3- and 5-year AUCs (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) were 0.996 and 0.989 (Figure 6(b)), which proved the stability and reliability of the model. Finally, six miRNAs (3/3, up/down) corresponded to 79 lncRNAs (31/48, up/down) and were associated with these nine mRNAs (5/4, up/down). The ceRNA network based on their relationship was constructed using the Cytoscape platform (Figure 7(a)).\\n\\nAdditionally, Kaplan–Meier analyses for the ceRNA members showed that low expression of KLRD1 and high expression of LINC00520 significantly contributed to worse OS for patients with ChRCC (P < 0.05) (Figures 7(b) and 7(c)). Meanwhile, the low-risk group also showed obvious superiority over the high-risk group, despite its P value being slightly greater than 0.05 (P = 0.06016) (Figure 7(d)).\\n\\n4. Discussion'),\n",

Multi-RNA competition regulatory networks appear to play indispensable roles in the biological processes and courses of cancer diseases [16, 17]. Several studies have explored and verified ceRNA networks in the past. Wang et al. included 407 normal and 151 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) (https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/) and TCGA datasets in their study. They found that the ceRNA network in AML involved 108 lncRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 8 mRNAs, which appeared to influence prognosis and cancer progression [18]. Meanwhile, Yao et al. also established a ceRNA network from TCGA database comprising 52 lncRNAs, 17miRNAs, and 79 mRNAs in breast cancer's RNA matrix and in which five lncRNAs were found to significantly affect patients' OS. Furthermore, results of GO and KEGG analyses of these mRNAs were also related to biological characteristics of tumors [19].\\n\\nWGCNA is a bioinformatic and sensitive method, which is especially suitable for these large and high-dimensional data, as well as for low abundance or fold change genes. It is able to cluster highly related genes from microarray samples into different color modules and explore the relationship between the genes and cancer traits [20]. WGCNA has already been used in various oncological studies to explore hub genes and the regulatory relationships between them [21–23]. In our study, we preformed WGCNA to select highly related module genes, which helped us elucidate the more meaningful RNAs for further prediction.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Importantly, prediction in multiple datasets allowed us to rapidly lockdown the shared high-value genes similar to previous studies [24–27]. Another advantage of our study was the application of univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions on selected target mRNAs from which we obtained a reliable and stable prognostic model and identified important genetic biomarkers for ChRCC within the ceRNA network. The excellent C-index and 3- and 5-year survival AUCs further proved the superiority of our model. The Kaplan–Meier curves showed that low-risk patients would achieve better long-term OS.\\n\\nA member of the cell adhesion molecule gene family, CADM2, has been reported to be underexpressed in the nine mRNAs. This might contribute to the progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and clear renal cell cancer (cRCC) [28–32]. CADM2 is believed to prevent tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis by maintaining cell's polarity and adhesion [32].\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"\\n\\nTyrosine protein kinase (KIT) is overexpressed in various cancers [33, 34], especially in ChRCC and oncocytoma. Huo et al. reported that KIT was more sensitive to ChRCC and oncocytoma than other renal cancers, and hence, it would be useful in precise tumor classification and targeted therapy [35, 36]. In the past, SFRP1 has been considered to be a tumor suppressor gene and possibly antagonistic to the wnt signaling pathway [37]. It has been found that increased methylation levels in the SFRP1 promoter region might lead to SFRP1 silencing in cRCC [38, 39]. Meanwhile, low SLC7A11 expression was found to be an important target in the p53 tumor suppression pathway, which is closely related to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. As the main component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, underexpressed SLC7A11 could inhibit cellular uptake of cystine and eventually lead to increased cell sensitivity to ferroptosis [40]. Additionally, upregulation of ARHGAP29 might be related to metastasis in gastric cancer [41]. ALPL is primarily related to hypophosphatemia [42]. Rao et al. found that high expression of ALPL led to poor survival outcomes for patients with prostate cancer [43]. However, another study proposed that ALPL could inhibit the motility and aggression of serous ovarian cancer cells [44]. High expression of KLRD1 was reported to inhibit the function of natural killer cells and cytokine-induced killer cells [45, 46]. PSD3 is considered to be a candidate metastasis suppressor gene, and its low expression has been observed to be associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and metastasis in breast cancer [47, 48]. Moreover, MYBL1 is highly expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma and is often accompanied by genomic rearrangements [49]. These previous findings lend confidence to the hypothesis that the ceRNA network plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cancers. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the role of these mRNAs in the ChRCC, in which KLRD1 was found by Kaplan–Meier analysis (P = 2.344e − 2) to significantly affect patients' OS.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Previous studies involving cRCC have reported the importance of the six miRNAs (hsa-mir-222, hsa-mir-204, hsa-mir-206, hsa-mir-183, hsa-mir-372, and hsa-mir-221) in the ceRNA network. In particular, hsa-mir-206, hsa-mir-204, and hsa-mir-372 were found to suppress cancer through corresponding biological functions [50–52], and hsa-mir-183 was considered to be a potential oncogene [53]. Kaplan–Meier analysis also showed that high expression of LINC00520 had an effect on OS. Chen et al., in their study based on the cBioPortal dataset, also emphasized its importance in cRCC [54]. However, more studies are needed to fully explore the biological function of the lncRNAs in ChRCC.\\n\\nIn this study, we constructed a ceRNA network including 79 lncRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 9 mRNAs. Their possible competitive synergistic biological functions might jointly regulate various processes in ChRCC, and, hence, they may provide new therapeutic targets and a new perspective for ChRCC genetic biology studies. However, there were some limitations to our study. Firstly, the prognostic model of mRNA has not been externally verified. Also, we lacked in vivo and in vitro experiments to verify our results.\\n\\n5. Conclusions\\n\\nWe established the ceRNA network in ChRCC, which included 79 lncRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 9 mRNAs. Among them, three mRNAs (CADM2, SFRP1, and KLRD1) and one lncRNA (LINC00520) showed promise as potential biomarkers for ChRCC. Our results offer new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of ChRCC and demonstrate the merit of further genetic biology research into ChRCC.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nYu-Chang Tian and Guan-Qiang Tian from the People's Hospital of Deyang City are appreciated for their contribution in the statistical analysis of this study.\\n\\nData Availability\\n\\nThe dataset supporting the conclusions of this study is available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.\\n\\nConflicts of Interest\\n\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\\n\\nAuthors' Contributions\"),\n",

CCD is caused by mutation in the gene on 6p21 encoding transcription factor CBFA1, i.e. runt−related transcription factor 2(RUNX2). The disease is characterized by a persistently open anterior fontanelle and skull sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, dental abnormalities, short stature, a wide pubic symphysis, and a variety of other skeletal changes. A major finding of CCD is hypoplasia or aplasia of clavicular bones resulting in the ability of the patient to approximate the shoulders. Delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle and of metopic sutures causes frontal bossing.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nINTRODUCTION\\nCleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare dominantly inherited autosomal bone disease that is characterized by delayed closure of fontanelles, presence of open skull sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, supernumerary teeth, delayed eruption of permanent dentition, wide pubic symphysis, short stature and a variety of other skeletal changes. Delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle and metopic sutures results in frontal bossing. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from mildly affected individuals with dental anomalities only to severely affected patients with syringomyelia (1, 2). CCD is also known as Marie−Sainton disease, mutational dysostosis, and cleidocranial dysostosis (3). Human osteoblast−specific, runt−related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene located on chromosome 6p21 is identified as the gene responsible for CCD (4).\\n\\nHere, we report a case of CCD in a 3.5−year−old boy and emphasize the importance of clinical examination findings.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 3.5−year−old boy was referred to our clinic because of unclosed anterior fontanelle. He was born at 40 weeks gestation to healthy parents, and his birth weight was 3300 g. He started walking at age 11 months.\\n\\nPhysical examination revealed a weight of 15 kg (25−50th percentile), height of 92 cm (3−10th percentile), and head circumference of 53 cm (50th percentile). The anterior fontanelle was open, with vertical and horizontal diameters of 4 cm and 3 cm, respectively. A high−arched palate, low nasal bridge, dental deformities, hyperodontia, mandibular retrognathism, brachiocephalic head and face were also noted. The right clavicle was absent, the shoulders were ptotic and hypermobile (Figure 1). Other system examinations were normal. The family history revealed no other member with bony abnormalities, delayed ossification, or short stature.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Laboratory investigations showed normal serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels. Thyroid function tests were within normal ranges.\\n\\nBone age was 4 years. Bone radiography demonstrated a large anterior fontanelle, wormian bones, a sclerotic skull base, multiple supernumerary teeth and malocclusion (Figures 2a and 2b), aplasia of the right clavicle and a hypoplastic left clavicle, a narrow chest, hypoplastic distal phalanges, cone−shaped epiphyses of middle phalanges (Figures 3a and 3b), a wide pubic symphysis, and coxa vara (Figure 4).\\n\\nBased on these clinical and radiological findings, the patient was diagnosed as a case of CCD.\\n\\nFigure 1 Facial appreance and hypermobile shoulders\\nFigures 2a Large anterior fontanelle, wormian bones, sclerotic skull base\\n2b Multiple supernumerary teeth\\nFigures 3a Aplasia of the right clavicle\\n3b Hypoplasia of distal phalanges and cone−shaped epiphyses of middle phalanges\\nFigure 4 Wide pubic symphysis and coxa vara\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe major features of CCD are aplastic or hypoplastic clavicles, dental abnormalities (multiple supernumerary teeth, multiple impacted permanent teeth, retention of the deciduous teeth), and delayed closure of the sagittal fontanelles. Typically, our patient had all of these findings that are pathognomonic for a diagnosis of CCD (1). Other findings of CCD are short stature, a bell−shaped thorax, hypoplasia of the pelvis, enlargement of the frontal and occipital bones, and phalangeal abnormalities. Shortened or absent nasal bones, paranasal sinus abnormalities, thickening of some segments of the calvaria, small maxillae, and delayed union of the mandibular symphysis are less common findings of CCD. There is a notably phenotypic variation of CCD even within one and the same family. In approximately 40% of CCD patients, a genetic transition cannot be identified, and the condition develops spontaneously (1, 5, 6, 7).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Clavicules are underdeveloped to varying degrees in these patients and are completely absent in approximately 10 percent. This allows excessive mobility of the shoulder girdle, as was also observed in our patient.\\n\\nDental abnormality is one of the main features of CCD. Our patient had multiple supernumerary teeth, which can impede the normal eruption of permanent teeth. It has been suggested that supernumerary teeth in such cases should be removed as soon as possible (6, 7, 8).\\n\\nThe main finding in our patient was an open anterior fontanelle. Delayed closure of fontanelles could be a feature of hypothyroidism, rickets, hypophosphatasia, osteogenesis\\n\\nimperfecta, pycnodysostosis, and other syndromes such as Apert syndrome, Dubowitz syndrome, Russell−Silver syndrome, Down’s syndrome, and Crouzon syndrome (10). When other characteristic features are taken into account, CCD can be differentiated easily from the other skeletal disorders and syndromes.\\n\\nIt is known that CCD is caused by heterozygous mutations in RUNX2 gene, which encodes a transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation and is located on chromosome 6p21 (1, 9). Many mutations in the RUNX2 gene have been identified in patients with CCD.\\n\\nIn conclusion, CCD should be kept in mind by pediatricians as a cause of delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle. Although the clinical findings of CCD are present at birth, diagnosis of the disease is often delayed. Thus, we want once again to draw attention to the importance of physical examination in the diagnosis of this disease.'),\n",

ARX function is frequently affected by naturally occurring mutations. Nonsense mutations, polyalanine tract expansions and missense mutations in ARX cause a range of intellectual disability and epilepsy phenotypes with or without additional features including hand dystonia, lissencephaly, autism or dysarthria. Severe malformation phenotypes, such as X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (XLAG), are frequently observed in individuals with protein truncating or missense mutations clustered in the highly conserved paired-type homeodomain.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Results\\nWe have identified two novel point mutations in the R379 residue of the ARX homeodomain; c.1135C>A, p.R379S in a patient with infantile spasms and intellectual disability and c.1136G>T, p.R379L in a patient with XLAG. We investigated these and other missense mutations (R332P, R332H, R332C, T333N: associated with XLAG and Proud syndrome) predicted to affect the nuclear localisation sequences (NLS) flanking either end of the ARX homeodomain. The NLS regions are required for correct nuclear import facilitated by Importin 13 (IPO13). We demonstrate that missense mutations in either the N- or C-terminal NLS regions of the homeodomain cause significant disruption to nuclear localisation of the ARX protein in vitro. Surprisingly, none of these mutations abolished the binding of ARX to IPO13. This was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immmuno fluorescence studies. Instead, tagged and endogenous IPO13 remained bound to the mutant ARX proteins, even in the RanGTP rich nuclear environment. We also identify the microtubule protein TUBA1A as a novel interacting protein for ARX and show cells expressing mutant ARX protein accumulate in mitosis, indicating normal cell division may be disrupted.\\n\\nConclusions\\nWe show that the most likely, common pathogenic mechanism of the missense mutations in NLS regions of the ARX homeodomain is inadequate accumulation and distribution of the ARX transcription factor within the nucleus due to sequestration of ARX with IPO13.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"==== Body\\nBackground\\nThe genes on the X-chromosome contribute significantly to genetic aetiology of intellectual disability [1]. The Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX) [GenBank: NM_139058.2] is one of the more frequent contributors [1]. ARX belongs to a subset of Aristaless-related Paired-class (Prd-class) homeodomain proteins [2] and contains multiple domains, including the aristaless domain, homeodomain, the octapeptide and 4 polyalanine tracts [3]. ARX mutations cause intellectual disability with or without additional features including epilepsy, infantile spasms, dystonia, lissencephaly, autism and dysarthia [3-5]. To date, over 90 families and individual cases with 40 different types of mutations have been reported. These include missense mutations, protein truncations but most frequently, polyalanine tract expansions [6-19].\\n\\nWhen Arx was first ablated in mouse [5], the phenotype recapitulated many clinical aspects of X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia [XLAG; MIM 300215] [20,21]. Subsequently, this led to the identification of ARX mutations in patients with XLAG [5]. Lissencephaly is one of a heterogenous group of disorders arising from aberrant neuronal migration. The characteristic 'smooth brain', due to a paucity of normal gyri and sulci, is due to either the arrest of neuronal migration (classical) or an over-migration of neurons (cobblestone). Mutations in the X-linked gene DCX (MIM 300121) [22] and four autosomal genes: LIS1 (MIM 601545) [23], RELN (MIM 600514) [24], TUBA1A (MIM 602529) [25,26] and VLDLR (MIM 192977) [27] have been associated with distinct lissencephaly syndromes. However, mutations in ARX are the only identified genetic cause underlying the distinct syndrome of XLAG. This syndrome differs from the other forms of lissencephaly, displaying a thickened cortex with posterior to anterior gradient of gyral malformation, agenesis of the corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia [28].\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='There are currently 31 families reported with XLAG phenotypes, with and without additional features, due to 27 different mutations in ARX. The majority of these families are predicted to arise from protein truncation and the loss-of-function of the mature ARX protein [5,7,9,12,28-31]. In the remaining families with XLAG, single nucleotide substitutions clustered in the homeodomain or, in one case, just prior to the aristaless domain, are predicted to give rise to amino acid substitutions in the mature protein. Several of these single nucleotide substitutions occur in residues of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) that flank both ends of the ARX homeodomain. In the N-terminal NLS (NLS2) there are four naturally occurring point mutations - R332P, R332H and R332C which cause XLAG and a residue adjacent to this arginine, T333N, which causes Proud syndrome (agenesis of the corpus callosum with ambiguous genitalia) [ACC/AG; MIM 30004]. We have recently identified novel point mutations in a single residue of the NLS3 region flanking the C-terminal portion of the homeodomain, R379. In one case, a substitution of R379 with lysine (L) has been identified in a patient presenting a phenotype of XLAG (D Coman, unpublished data). In contrast, a second change in the same residue resulting in the substitution of R379 with serine (S) was identified in a proband and his female relatives [32]. Interestingly, the phenotype includes infantile spasms and severe mental retardation without obvious brain malformation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The basic residues of ARX NLS2 and NLS3 are important for the correct localization of ARX in the nucleus through interaction with Importin 13 (IPO13) [33]. IPO13 is a member of the importin-β superfamily involved in nuclear import and export of a variety of proteins [34,35]. In addition to IPO13, a recent study suggests that multiple importins are utlized to import murine Arx into the nucleus, including importin β1 [36]. Regardless of the importin utilized, the driving force for nuclear protein import is provided by RanGTP and its interaction with the importin-cargo complex [37]. We show that missense mutations of NLS2 and NLS3 cause significant disruption to the nuclear localization of ARX in vitro. However, these mutations do not abolish the binding of ARX to IPO13. Interestingly, the binding of mutant ARX protein to endogenous IPO13 is indistinguishable from the binding to N-terminally truncated IPO13 lacking the RanGTPase binding domain. Hence, the ability of the mutant ARX-IPO13 complex to uncouple in the RanGTP rich nuclear environment appears to be compromised. As part of our investigation into the pathogenic mechanism underlying these mutations we identify TUBA1A, a component of the cytoskeleton important in mitosis, as a novel protein partner for ARX and examine the impact of sequestration of mutant ARX cargo with IPO13 on mitosis and cell division.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\nSubjects and families\\nThe relevant research ethics committees and institutional review boards of collaborating institutions approved this study.

In the first case a clinical diagnosis of XLAG phenotype included mildly dysmorphic features, ambiguous genitalia with a micropenis, fused scrotum, cryptorchidism and a severe refractory seizure disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified lissencephaly with agyria posteriorly transitioning in the mid-parietal region to pachygyria anteriorly, agenesis of the corpus callosum and a severe encephalopathy (Figure 1a-c). Other clinical findings include hypothalamic dysfunction, hypophosphatasia and severe chronic diarrhoea with evidence of pancreatic insufficiency and small bowel malabsorption. No developmental milestones were attained and the disease was ultimately lethal. The c.1136G>T mutation was not found in the mother of the patient and her MRI brain scan showed a normally formed corpus callosum (data not shown). In the second case, the associated phenotype of carrier females of the c.1135C>A mutation from the family were reported [32]. We report here the clinical findings of the male proband, who had a history of infantile spasms and severe intellectual disability (Figure 1 Family 2, patient III-4). He was born after a pregnancy of 39 weeks by spontaneous delivery with a birth weight of 2600 g. In the first months eye contact was not adequate. At the age of 6 months he experienced seizures with tonic extension of the arms and turning of the eye globes, which progressively increased in frequency and were followed by apnoea. The electroencephalograph showed a disorganized background pattern compatible with hypsarrhythmia. On examination he was apathetic, made no eye contact and showed insufficient spontaneous movements. His head growth progressively slowed and at 6 years of age his occipitofrontal circumference was below -2SD. He had no significant psychomotor development and at 5 years of age had spastic tetraparesis with truncal hypotonia. At 8 years of age he is wheelchair bound, makes no eye contact, reacts to touch and can chew and swallow food. He has recurrent airway infections. His seizures are refractory to medical treatment, notwithstanding the use of several antiepileptic drug medications. Interestingly, this patient showed no XLAG or brain malformation when examined by MRI (data not shown). The patient had unilateral cryptorchidism. The presence of dry scaly skin prompted testing for steroid sulphatase deficiency and the diagnosis was confirmed by genomic DNA analysis that showed an STS gene deletion and leukocytes enzyme assay that showed reduced activity (data not shown). The borders of the STS deletion were fine mapped in another family member with the same deletion by 250 K SNP arrays and were comprised between SNP_A-2122915 and SNP_A-1933813 on chromosome Xp22.'),\n",

We tested R332P, T333N, R379L and R379S mutations (Figure 2A). We used confocal microscopy to analyse subcellular localisation, highlighted for the R379L mutation (Figure 2B). Aggregates are clearly distinguished in the peri-nuclear region of the cytoplasm, with a large aggregate mass in the top right quadrant. In addition to the cytoplasmic localisation, a series of aggregates in the nuclear space can be identified. The percentage of transfected cells with aberrant sub-cellular localisation of ARX protein was assessed in at least 1000 transfected cells from a minimum of three separate transfection experiments. For counting purposes, transfected cells were categorised as (1) normal localization; diffuse staining restricted to the nucleus (Figure 2C, top panel) or (2) abnormal localization, aggregates of mutant protein in either the nucleus or in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 2C). Expression of the Myc-tagged ARX-Wt protein was detected in a non-homogenous pattern across the nucleus with little or no expression detectable in the cytoplasm. We observed this normal pattern of staining in over 87% of cells transfected with ARX-Wt at 24 hrs (Figure 2D) and 91% of cells at 48 h post-transfection (data not shown). Transient over-expression leads to aberrant localization of the ARX-Wt protein in approximately 13% of transfected cells (Figure 2D), generally in the form of a single bright spot in the nucleus in addition to the normal diffuse staining (data not shown). In contrast, ARX NLS mutant proteins were found within the nucleus as either multiple, small aggregates, or longer continuous 'ribbon like structures' or larger aggregates in which the DAPI stained nuclear material had been excluded. The mutant protein was also found in aggregates in the cytoplasm, often forming large bodies to one side of the nucleus distorting the DAPI stained nuclear material (Figure 2C). Routinely, cells with abnormal localization of the mutant protein were a mixture of cells with aggregates in the nucleus and no detectable expression of ARX in the cytoplasm, in addition to cells with aggregates of mutant ARX in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. No cells with ARX protein exclusively in the cytoplasm were noted. The percentages of transfected cells with abnormal ARX protein localization were significantly elevated for all NLS mutations tested compared to ARX-Wt transfected cells (Figure 2D). Mutations leading to severe clinical outcomes resulted in the highest levels of cells with abnormal protein localization. Over-expression of R332P for 24 h resulted in 72% of transfected cells in which the mutant protein was incorrectly localized; an approx 5.5-fold increase compared to the 13% of ARX-Wt transfected cells. The T333N mutation, adjacent to the NLS2 region, mis-localized in 61% of transfected cells. Similarly, the R379L mutation resulted in 60% of all transfected cells with abnormal protein localization (Figure 2D). Unlike the other three mutations, the R379S mutaiton leads to a phenotype without malformation of the brain. In cells expressing the R379S mutation the increase in cells with abnormal localisation of mutant protein was the lowest of all the mutations tested at 54% (Figure 2D). In contrast to the NLS mutations, when another mutation the middle of the ARX homeodomain (P353L; XMESID phenotype) was expressed in HEK293T cells there were no increased levels of cells with mis-localized protein compared to ARX-Wt (Figure 2D). When a single construct containing two mutations (R332P and R379L) was transfected into HEK293T cells we found 90% of all of transfected cells displayed abnormal localisation of the mutant protein (Figure 2D). This increase was above the effect of either mutation alone and indicates the NLS regions flanking the homeodomain are not redundant but likely act co-operatively.\"),\n",

We identified alpha-tubulin (TUBA1A; NM_006009.2) and beta-tubulin (TUBB3; NM_006086.2) from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The bait protein used in this instance was the human ARX homeodomain (aa 303-431) fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD). This protein did not autoactivate the HIS3, lacZ or URA3 reporter genes upon transformation of MaV203 yeast (data not shown). Given the involvement of mutations in TUBA1A in phenotypes with lissencephaly and other similar clinical findings to the severe XLAG phenotype due to mutations in ARX we wanted to investigate the novel interaction between ARX and TUBA1A further. As there is a high level of similarity between members of the alpha-tubulin family and we predicted that ARX may interact not only with the brain specific TUBA1A but also with other members of the family. We confirmed this interaction in mammalian cells by Co-IP. Overexpressed Myc-tagged ARX was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. Endogenous alpha-tubulin immunoprecipiated with Myc-ARX was detected by rabbit anti-alpha-tubulin antibody (raised against a common immunogen; aa 417 to 441 of TUBA1A, NP_00600.2) (Figure 7). When we tested the mutations in the NLS regions of ARX we observed Co-IP of alpha-tubulin for all samples, but not in parallel samples in which no IP antibody was added (Figure 7). Our data indicates that alpha-tubulin interacts with the homeodomain of ARX and this interaction is not abolished by any of the NLS mutations tested. Despite the interaction of ARX and alpha-tubulin by yeast-2 hybrid studies and Co-IP, in cells co-stained for Myc-ARX and alpha-tubulin we did not see any apparent co-localization of the two proteins.

In cells expressing the ARX NLS mutations there was also a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the middle phase of mitosis at both 24 and 48 h post-transfection compared to the ARX-Wt protein. Interestingly, the percentages of cells in the late phase of mitosis expressing NLS mutations were also significantly higher than ARX-Wt at 48 h post-transfection (Figure 9B) but not at 72 h (data not shown). This indicates that cells expressing the ARX NLS mutation proteins are progressing through cell division at a slower rate compared to the ARX-Wt protein.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Discussion\\nWe have established that naturally occurring patient mutations leading to non-synonymous changes of single, specific residues of the NLS regions cause significant disruption to nuclear localization of the mutant ARX protein in vitro. These findings were consistent in all NLS2 and NLS3 mutations tested, indicating the mechanism involved may be similar for missense mutations in both NLS2 and NLS3 regions of the ARX homeodomain. Consistent with the severity of clinical outcomes, mutations leading to severe malformation phenotypes had the highest percentages of cells with abnormal mutant protein localization while the mutation causing ISSX but not brain malformation gave the smallest, but still significant, increase in cells with abnormal protein localization compared to the ARX-Wt protein. In contrast to the NLS mutations, another ARX mutation in the middle of the homeodomain, but outside of the NLS regions, did not disrupt the nuclear localization of the mutant protein with the subcellular localization of the mutant protein the same as the ARX-Wt protein.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The NLS regions flanking the ARX homeodomain are predicted to be important in the bi-partite binding to IPO13 [33,34]. We wanted to investigate if changing single, specific residues of the NLS regions would diminish or potentially abolish binding of the mutant NLS with IPO13. The interaction of importins and cargo proteins are often difficult to visualize or measure, as these interactions are highly transient with efficient recycling of the importin proteins back to the cytoplasm after delivery of the cargo to the nucleus. In order to capture this interaction, N-terminal truncated V5-IPO13 was engineered to enable binding to cargo and transport across the nucleus coupled with an inability to interact with RanGTP and dissociate upon reaching the nucleus [33]. Both the Co-IP and co-localization results indicate single amino acid substitutions in either the NLS2 or NLS3 regions of the ARX homeodomain did not abolish binding of the mutant ARX protein to N-terminally truncated V5-IPO13. Moreover, protein containing both R332P and R379L mutations was still able to bind to V5-IPO13.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Interestingly, binding of mutant ARX protein to endogenous IPO13 was indistinguishable from the binding to the N-terminally truncated IPO13 lacking the RanGTPase binding domain. The interaction of endogenous IPO13 with mutant ARX protein implies that the binding of these two proteins not only occurs but that this complex is either unable to correctly transport across the nuclear pore or unable to discharge the ARX cargo once inside the nucleus, or both. We contend that the inability of mutant ARX to uncouple from endogenous IPO13 contributes to the overall increase in cells with abnormal localisation of ARX protein. In support of this suggestion, co-transfection of ARX-Wt protein with the N-terminally truncated IPO13 led to a marked increase in the proportion of transfected cells with abnormal localization compared to cells transfected with ARX-Wt alone. Hence, disruption of normal nuclear delivery and distribution of mutant ARX protein may be due to a compromised ability of the mutant ARX-IPO13 complex to uncouple in the presence of RanGTP. Inadequate nuclear accumulation of a transcription factor due to impaired interaction with importin-β has been suggested as the pathogenic mechanism behind mutations in the C-terminal NLS of the SRY gene leading to XY genotype developing as females [38]. A similar scenario of inadequate accumulation and distribution of the mutant ARX protein within the nucleus might ultimately mimic complete absence of ARX and contribute to the catastrophic phenotypic consequences routinely observed in patients with these mutations. This prediction fits with the emerging genotype-phenotype pattern for mutations in ARX. In particular, naturally occurring mutations such as insertions [5,7,9,12], deletions [5,28-31], nonsense changes [30] and splice mutations [30] in ARX that result in protein truncation and loss-of function of the mature ARX protein invariably lead to severe phenotypes, including XLAG.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Both arginine residues examined in this study, R332 in NLS2 and R379 in NLS3 of ARX, are invariant in all 26 paired-type homeodomain proteins. Within this family of proteins these two basic residues are frequent sites of missense and nonsense mutations associated with a range of diseases. A mutation in the homologous NLS2 residue has been reported for ALX4 (MIM 605420) [39] and mutations in the homologous NLS3 residue have been identified in CRX (MIM 602225) [40], OTX2 (MIM 600037) [41] and SHOX (MIM 312865) [42,43]. Mutations in both residues corresponding to the R332 and R379 of ARX have been identified in PAX3 (MIM 606597) [44,45], PAX6 (MIM 607108) [46,47], PITX2 (MIM 601542) [48-50] and PROP1 (MIM 601538) [51-54]. A mutation in the conserved residue at position 50 of the paired-type homeodomain SHOX results in the abolition of DNA binding [55]. This residue corresponds to R379 of ARX. However, this residue is not part of the NLS region of the SHOX protein. When a residue within the NLS is mutated (R173C of SHOX) this change does not affect the DNA binding but instead disrupts the nuclear transport of SHOX. This may also be the case with the mutations tested in our study. There is no doubt that some of the missense mutations in the ARX homeodomain are likely to be important in either specificity of binding or in the actual binding to DNA. For example, the P353L mutation did not disrupt nuclear location of the resulting protein. Perhaps this mutation leads to the severe XMESID phenotype due to changes in binding to DNA targets. The recent identification of a specific transcription factor-binding site for Arx in a study ablating Arx in the sub-palluim of the mouse brain [56] will provide an important tool to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of mutations in the ARX homeodomain in the future.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nA recent examination of heterozygous females from families with known mutations in ARX has highlighted the fact that in some cases mutations that disrupt ARX in females may have pathogenic consequences [32]. In particular, a number of females with the T333N and R379S mutations display mental retardation or learning disabilities, although other female carriers of the same mutation are phenotypically normal [30,32]. Our data indicates that in addition to a predicted loss of normal transcription factor activity of ARX, sequestration of mutant ARX with IPO13 may lead to a disruption of interactions with other protein partners, contributing to the disease phenotype. An emerging feature of many forms of lissencephaly and pachygyria is the potential disruption of key elements of microtubule behaviour. For example, one of the key genes mutated in lissencephaly is doublecortin (DCX). Mutations in DCX are clustered in two tubulin binding domains and impair the polymerization of microtubules and as such correct neuronal migration [57]. Interestingly, DCX does not bind to the tubulin heterodimer itself but acts to nucleate the microtubule growth and to stabilize microtubules. More recently, mutations in TUBA1A have been reported to cause lissencephaly with a distinct clinical presentation, ranging from perisylvian pachygyria in the less severe form, to posteriorly predominant pachygyria in the most severe form, in association with dysgenesis of the anterior limb of the internal capsule and mild to severe cerebellar hypoplasia [58]. A recurrent mutation in TUBA1A compromises the efficiency of de novo alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimer formation [59]. We have shown that ARX interacts with TUBA1A by Co-IP, but the two proteins do not appear to co-localize during normal cell growth. However, in cells expressing mutant ARX we observed a disruption of the mitotic spindle structures and an accumulation of cells in the early stages of mitosis. Hence, neurons, which normally express ARX during the development of the sequestration of mutant ARX, might compromise the interaction with TUBA1A, disrupt normal microtubule formation and subsequently retard efficient cell division.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We cannot rule out the possibility that sequestration of IPO13 in these cells may also contribute to pathogenesis. The dynamic cycling of Ran between the GTP and GDP bound forms is exquisitely controlled by specific regulators differentially localized within the cellular environment [60]. The RanGAP, which accelerates GTP hydrolysis, is cytoplasmic. The Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor, also known as RCC1 (regulator of chromatin condensation 1), is located in the nucleus bound to chromatin. Hence, the levels of RanGTP increase in proximity to chromatin. Importin proteins bind and inhibit spindle accessory factors (SAF) everywhere in the mitotic cytosol, except in the vicinity of the chromosome. The high levels of RanGTP close to the chromatin relieve the inhibition of SAFs by importins and subsequently allow local spindle assembly. RanGTP binding to importin protein generates conformation change in the Importin molecule that in turn alters the binding site of the importin for the cargo proteins [37]. Therefore, IPO13 trapped in complex with mutant ARX may not be able to adequately bind SAFs and as such compromise spindle assembly. Samples of the cortex taken at autopsy from the patient with the R379L mutation were stained with neurofilament immunoperoxidase and, interestingly, a paucity of neurons was noted (D Coman, unpublished data). The authors could not rule out the contribution of perinatal ischemia to the histological findings. However, in light of our findings, it is interesting to speculate that disruption of the mitotic spindle due to sequestration of mutant ARX with IPO13 retards cell division, potentially contributing to a disruption in neuronal migration and correct lamination patterns of the brain leading to lissencephaly and associated clinical outcomes.'),\n",

Bisphosphonate therapy can increase bone marrow\\xa0density (BMD), although the BMD response typically reaches a plateau in two to three years [3].\\n\\nThere is evidence to suggest that prolonged use of bisphosphonates can suppress bone remodeling and increase the risk of atypical fractures. For this reason, physicians can consider a drug holiday after long-term bisphosphonate use (three to 10 years) to reduce the risk of such complications [1]. Reportedly, several prodromal symptoms are likely reported before atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) occur and physicians need to be aware of them in the patients for whom they are prescribing antiresorptive drugs [2].\\n\\nAtypical fractures occur frequently in the femoral subtrochanteric region or shaft [2]. Most reports of AFFs refer to unilateral cases. Here\\xa0we describe a rare case of simultaneous, bilateral AFFs.\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nAn 80-year-old female fell when walking. At the moment of catastrophic injury, the patient described hearing a noise coming from both thighs before falling to the ground.

A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan showed that her lumbar vertebral BMD was 54% of that of adults aged\\xa020-44 years. The patient's T-score in the spine was -3.7 and Z-score was -0.1. Blood tests indicated that her serum intact amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen was 128 μg/L (26.4-98.2) and her tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b was 541 μU/dL (120-420). The patient was diagnosed with simultaneous bilateral AFFs.

In contrast, in a systematic review of all case reports and case series of AFFs, Park-Wyllie et al. reported a median time of five years of bisphosphonate therapy prior to fracture [4]. AFFs represent approximately 0.5-1% of proximal femoral fractures [2]. There are few case reports of simultaneous bilateral AFFs; only seven published reports were retrieved during our search (Table 2). The duration of bisphosphonate use was only reported in five of seven published cases [5-10]. Three of those five documented cases were reports of bisphosphonate use for more than five years (Table 2) [5-7].

For patients who have been prescribed antiresorptive drugs (e.g., bisphosphonates or denosumab) and report such symptoms, physicians should consider performing full-length radiographs of both femurs [11]. Githens et al. suggested that if the patient is asymptomatic but presents with radiographic signs that raise concern about an impending atypical fracture, prophylactic IM nailing is recommended [12]. It has been shown that administration for teriparatide treatment in patients with an atypical fracture may help facilitate fracture healing, recovery of hip function, and pain relief when bone turnover is reduced [13].\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nIn summary, this case report describes AFFs that occurred bilaterally and concurrently. The fractures were associated with long-term bisphosphonate use. Open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures were performed using an IM nail system. Bone union was achieved, and the patient was eventually able to walk again without assistance. Typically, AFFs occur unilaterally, although in rare cases, they can occur bilaterally.

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nUnexpected skeletal dysplasia affects approximately 1 per 5,000 and is a complex group of bone and cartilage disorders with strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity (Geister and Camper, 2015). In the 2015 revision of the Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders, 436 disorders are classified into 42 groups according to syndromes, publication, genetic information, and nosologic autonomy, and 364 different genes are associated with genetic skeletal disorders (Bonafe et al., 2015). Many of these disorders can give rise to prenatal phenotypes. In the past, ultrasound evaluation was a widely used method for detection of congenital anomalies (Krakow et al., 2009). However, the lack of family history and non-specific and limited clinical symptoms in utero may introduce difficulties in prenatal diagnosis. Recently, with the advances in molecular technology, especially next-generation sequencing, high-throughput sequencing has been considered as an effective method for different genetic diagnosis (Retterer et al., 2016; LaDuca et al., 2017). Based on the statements released by the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF), and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), next-generation sequencing can be used with ultrasound anomalies when standard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis, failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. Especially, if a specific diagnosis is suspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder should be the initial test. Thus, many studies have adopted this for prenatal evaluation (International Society for Prenatal et al., 2018; Monaghan et al., 2020). Thirty-one studies conducted prenatal analysis by whole exome sequencing (WES) with the diagnostic rates between 6.2 and 80% (Best et al., 2018). Notably, the application of targeted exome sequencing in prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia is outstanding as several researches have reported high detection rates from 75 to 83.3% (Chandler et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020). Definitive molecular diagnosis can provide accurate results instead of a suspected clinical impression and information about subsequent development of the disease and treatment regimens; thus, parents could get genetic counseling, and birth-defect intervention could be implemented for future pregnancies.'),\n",

DNA of the fetus and their parents were used to create the DNA libraries, enriched by IDT xGen Exome V2 reagent (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Iowa, United States), sequenced on the Illumina Nova6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States), and mapped to the human genome (NCBI37/hg19) by the Sentieon software package. Over 99% coverage of targeted bases was achieved, with an average sequencing depth of over 100. Then Picard was used to compare the results to remove redundancy, and the variants were detected by vVarscan. An in-house algorithm CNVexon developed by Fulgent Genetics was used for exon-based CNV detection based on reads counts, and a misalignment detection algorithm was used for pseudogenes' optimization. All variants were searched in multiple databases including gnomAD, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), dbSNP, 1000 Genome Project, Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), ClinVar and Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). Four prediction tools were used for variant interpretation: DANN, MutationTaster, REVEL, and SIFT. For splicing variants, Human Splicing Finder was used.

Several parameters were examined by ultrasound: biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, chest circumference, length of the long bones, shape of long bones, mandibular size and shape, abnormal posturing of the extremities, and other congenital anomalies. In 16 cases, we detected one deletion in DMD and causative variants in six genes, including FGFR3, COL1A1, COL1A2, ALPL, HSPG2, and DYNC2H1 with a detection rate of 75% (Table 1).\\n\\nAbnormalities Detected by SNP-array\\n\\nTwelve cases were tested for CNVs first by SNP-array. We found a 184 kb deletion in chromosome Xp21.1, which spanned from exon 49 to exon 53 of the DMD gene in case 1. At 24 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound scan showed that the fetal feet were ballet-shaped, and the angle of tibiofibula and dorsum of foot was near 180°. However, the fetus didn't receive a prenatal genetic test. When he was born, an SNP-array was conducted using his cord blood.

A total of 14 variants in 6 genes associated with skeletal dysplasia were detected in 11 cases (Table 1) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1B).\\n\\nIn case 2, two compound heterozygous causative mutations c.5984C>T (p.A1995V) and c.10606C>T (p.R3536X) (Qiao et al., 2018) in DYNC2H1 gene were detected. Mutations in DYNC2H1 were associated with short-rib thoracic dysplasia 3 (Merrill et al., 2009). Short rib-polydactyly syndrome 3 (SRPS 3) was an autosomal recessive disease overlapping with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy belonging to the ciliopathy, but it was more severe and characterized by early prenatal expression, lethality and variable malformations (Dagoneau et al., 2009), which was correlated with patient 2′s presentations.\\n\\nHypophosphatasia resulting from mutations in ALPL gene was found in case 3 (c.984_986del, c.1463C>G) and case 4 (c.2T>C, c.984_986del), respectively. Both of the mutations in these two cases presented compound heterozygous condition. c.984_986del leaded to the deletion of phenylalanine at position 328 at the β-sheet. c.2T>C caused the loss of the start codon, and the alanine residue at position 488 (c.1463C>G, p.A488G) was conserved in several species.\\n\\nMutations c.742C>T was detected in case 5, and c.1138G>A was detected in case 16, which were mutation hotspots of FGFR3 gene.

However, no pathogenic variants were identified in cases 7, 9, 11, and 15.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nMany aspects could affect the detection rate of WES, such as the number of cases, selected criteria of study, proband-only WES, or trio WES, and so on (Best et al., 2018). It was reported that trio WES had a higher diagnostic rate; fetuses with multiple anomalies also had a higher diagnostic rate and when testing single structural anomalies, a particular organ system may have a higher diagnostic yield (Best et al., 2018; International Society for Prenatal et al., 2018). Among the 16 cases in the present study, 12 cases received a definitive molecular diagnosis, including a microdeletion and 8 novel variants, and the detection rate is 75%, which is consistent with the high detection rates of skeletal dysplasia from 75 to 83.3% revealed by previous studies (Chandler et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020).'),\n",

He exhibited abnormal posturing of the lower extremities, which were not reported previously during the intrauterine period in patients with DMD/BMD. And the family has experienced one pregnancy with the same anomalies before without other information and further genetic analysis. To our knowledge, only one fetus with a deletion of exons 17–29 of the DMD gene was reported to present prenatal phenotypes including fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios (Lin et al., 2017). And the deletion of exons 49–53 of the DMD gene were detected in three patients with DMD/BMD as reported previously (Covone et al., 1991; Murugan et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2019). However, our patient was dead, and we could not get more information. Therefore, it is difficult to define these new symptoms in intrauterine period as phenotype expansion of DMD/BMD or genotype-phenotype discordance.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Moreover, we found mutations in ALPL in cases 3 and 4. Pathogenic variants in ALPL cause hypophosphatasia characterized by defective mineralization of bone and/or teeth in the presence of low activity of serum and bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Millan and Whyte, 2016). c.984_986del in cases 3 and 4 was reported previously (Chang et al., 2012; Taillandier et al., 2015), which result in the deletion of phenylalanine at the β-sheet and decreased activity of its coding protein the tissue-nonspecific isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) (Michigami et al., 2005). Thus, c.984_986del may reduce the enzymatic activity too. c.1460C>T (p.A487V) and c.1466G>C (p.C489S) were reported early, of which the latter one exhibited a diminished ALP activity, less located on the cell surface and failed to become the mature form (Satou et al., 2012; Porntaveetus et al., 2017). This suggested that p.487-489 of ALPL protein may play an important role in enzymatic activity. c.2T>C caused the loss of the start codon and generated a transcript starting at Met56 as c.3G>A did, which did not exhibit enzymatic activity, had no significant effect on the wild type ALPL protein, and could not be attached to the cell membrane (Mentrup et al., 2011).'),\n",

And patient 16 had a hotspot mutation c.1138G>A in FGFR3 (Xue et al., 2014). These fetuses' ultrasound scans all revealed a narrow chest with shortening of the long bones. Besides, c.8553del and c.12532+1G>T in HSPG2 were identified in case 10. HSPG2 is an essential gene, and its mutations could lead to Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, type 1(SJS) and severe neonatal lethal Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH) (Arikawa-Hirasawa et al., 2002; Martinez et al., 2018). However, the compound heterozygous condition couldn't be confirmed because the parents' samples were not available. Trio sequencing of patient 7 and the parents detected a heterozygous missense variation c.4813C>T in FLNB, which was inherited from the normal father with 62 of 120 (51.7%) reads. Though several cases with family history presenting an autosomal dominant trait has been reported (Doren et al., 1998; Xu et al., 2018), the father in case 7 didn't have malformations associated with FLNB-related disorders such as short stature, club feet, and facial dysmorphisms (Bicknell et al., 2007).\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"\\n\\nFurthermore, variants of type I collagen genes related to osteogenesis imperfect (OI) were identified in five cases. Type I collagen is a heterotrimer containing two α1(I) and one α2(I) chains assembled by procollagen chains with N-terminal and C-terminal globular propeptides flanking the helical domain (Forlino and Marini, 2016). The helical domains contain Gly-X-Y triplets where glycine substitutions are the most frequent cause of OI (Marini et al., 2007). In our study, we detected four missense mutations and one splicing variant: c.1921G>A and c.3389G>A in COL1A1 and c.1010G>A, c.2189G>T, and c.1764+3_1764+6del in COL1A2, respectively (Figure 2B). Four missense mutations were glycine substitutions in Gly-X-Y, which would delay helical folding and prolong access time for modifying enzymes. Previous researches have described two infants with c.2188G>T (p.G730C) and c.2188G>C (p.G730R) in COL1A2 changing the same amino acid residue as c.2189G>T (p.G730V) and exhibited the same phenotypes such as blue sclera, wormian bones, and shortening and bowing of the upper and lower limbs (Gomez-Lira et al., 1994; Hachiya et al., 2012). The similar situation was observed in c.1010G>A and c.1921G>A. And c.3389G>A in COL1A1 has been classified as likely pathogenic in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). The splicing mutation c.1764+3_1764+6del in COL1A2 in case 8 may yield abnormal splicing transcript as predicted by Human Splicing Finder. Notably, the variants in cases 8 and 12 were maternally inherited. Both of the mothers experienced induced abortion twice in the second trimester due to the same skeletal dysplasia malformation, suggesting the somatic mosaicism. The mutated allele c.3389G>A was present in 17 of 66 (25.8%) reads in WES, and the peak of mutated allele was lower than that of the wild-type allele in sanger sequencing, suggesting that it is a mosaic mutation in the mother of case 12. After that, we tried to recall the asymptomatic mother; however, she didn't receive radiographical examination, and we only knew that her sclera and height were normal and didn't suffer bone fracture before. Similarly, the mutated allele c.1764+3_1764+6del was present in 22 of 68 (32.3%) reads in the mother of case 8 who presented extremely mild symptoms such as short stature compared with the fetus. Nevertheless, the ratio of the fetus was 37.8% (17/45) similar to the mother. We supposed that other factors such as underlying genetic modifiers may affect the phenotypes.\"),\n",

For fetuses, several aspects could affect the detection rate, especially incomplete prenatal phenotypes (Aarabi et al., 2018). Meanwhile, many challenges should be considered, such as ethical concerns, analysis of variants of unknown significance, and secondary findings (Best et al., 2018; Monaghan et al., 2020). In the future, with the development of fetal specific phenotype genotype database, the uncertainty in cases will become less frequent (Aarabi et al., 2018). Furthermore, the causative variants of these four cases may reside in the noncoding-regulatory or deep-intronic regions could not be detected by WES, which could be analyzed by whole genome sequencing in the future.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn summary, one CNV and 14 single nucleotide variants of 6 genes were identified in 16 families with suspected skeletal abnormalities by prenatal ultrasound scan. The results of this study elucidated that the utilization of WES improved the diagnosis yield of skeletal dysplasia and provided useful genetic counseling guidance for parents. In addition, two cases with type I collagen variants from asymptomatic parent were also found, indicating the advantage of next generation sequencing in the detection of somatic mosaicism.

However, there is no consensus about best-practice methods to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in preschool children (<5 years) and data are often scarce. We reviewed methods used to capture the HRQoL of preschool children in past National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) appraisals to establish whether there is a need for better methods in this area and if so, to identify priority research areas. We identified past NICE appraisals that included preschool children, examining the methods used to generate utility values and whether committees believed these captured HRQoL adequately. Of the 12 appraisals, most used generic HRQoL measures designed for adults. Measures were usually completed by adult patients or clinical experts. Committees frequently commented on limitations in the HRQoL data. While acknowledging that data collection may be challenging, committees would value evidence based on HRQoL data from parents or guardians collected as part of a clinical trial. We identified several research priorities including the psychometric properties of existing measures; the feasibility and validity of valuation studies; and mapping. Progress in these areas will help ensure that the aspects of HRQoL which matter to children and their families are captured in NICE evaluations.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmc1. Introduction\\n\\nThe health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children and young people is often not measured in trials. Consequently, age-appropriate utility data are rarely available to inform economic models. One reason for paediatric utility data not being collected is a lack of methods guidance from either health technology assessment (HTA) agencies or the literature.\\n\\nIn the context of measuring health-related quality of life in children, NICE’s ‘Guide to the methods of technology appraisal 2013’ states that when necessary, consideration should be given to alternative measures to EQ-5D (which is the preferred measure of health-related quality of life in adults). These alternatives should be “standardised and validated preference-based measures of health-related quality of life that have been designed specifically for use in children.” [1]. A previous systematic review of UK paediatric cost–utility analyses found that the methods used for utility analysis were highly variable, and differed from the NICE reference case more often than other elements of the analysis [2]. Further reviews of paediatric cost-utility analyses which include studies from outside of the UK have found variations in methodological practice similar to those reported in the UK review, suggesting that other HTA agencies face similar challenges to NICE [3,4]. NICE is currently working on providing clearer guidance, including clarifying the desired properties for generic preference-accompanied instruments (that is, a health state descriptive system that is accompanied by a set of health state utility values) that measure children and young people’s quality of life. NICE’s updated guidance is informed by a systematic review of the psychometric properties of several measures undertaken by NICE’s Decision Support Unit [5].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='However, clearer guidance on use of preference-accompanied instruments is uninformative for studies of preschool children (defined in this report as children under five years), as most measures are designed for children over the age of five. Therefore, NICE is not currently able to provide explicit methods recommendations for this age group, and to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any HTA organisations which provide such recommendations. Furthermore, there are additional challenges when measuring and valuing HRQoL for preschool children, including the need for proxy measurement, whether measurement scales should focus on observable behaviour and accounting for rapid developmental change.\\n\\nWe reviewed past NICE appraisals that included preschool children to identify the methods and sources used to generate health state utility values and examine whether these were seen by the committee and evidence review group (ERG) to adequately capture the HRQoL of young children. We then used the findings of this review to identify priority research areas which may support the generation of age-appropriate evidence for preschool children.\\n\\n2. Methods'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2. Methods\\n\\nThis work builds upon a previous review, published by Hill et al., of health state utility values in NICE evaluations for people aged under 18, which included guidance published before November 2019 [6]. The Hill et al. review did not examine subgroups by age. The current review identified the subgroup of appraisals where children aged under five years were either included in the scope of the appraisal or were not explicitly outside of the marketing authorisation of the technology (24 of 40 of the appraisals identified in Hill et al.). To bring the search up to date, NICE technology appraisal (TA) and highly specialised technology (HST) guidance published from November 2019 to August 2020 was manually searched to identify additional evaluations including the target age group [7]. Guidance prior to April 2004 was excluded as this predated the existence of the NICE methods guide for technology appraisals. Consequently, pre-2004 appraisals tend to use less common methodological approaches; including these early appraisals could lead to outdated approaches being overrepresented in a relatively small data set.\\n\\nIn our analysis, we assessed which measure was used (e.g., EQ-5D or HUI3), who completed it (e.g., children, parents or clinicians) and how it was valued (that is, how the information about health-related quality of life was converted into utility scores on the scale where one is perfect health and zero is equivalent to dead). This information was drawn from the appraisal documents including final and draft guidance, company submission, ERG/assessment group report, technical reports and responses to consultation. In addition, descriptive data were extracted to identify themes related to: The company and ERG’s rationale for their preferred method, committee comments on the strengths and limitations of the chosen method and any additional comments relevant to the preschool population.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Having extracted the data, we observed that some appraisals had a broad age range (e.g., two to 18 years) but the bulk of the population was over the age of five, meaning that the evidence base and committee discussions focussed on these older children. Accordingly, we selected a final analysis set that included only those appraisals where the utility values used for preschool children were likely to be important in the context of the appraisal. The decision to include an appraisal in the final analysis set also took into account the natural history of the disease, whether preschool children were a distinct subgroup in the economic model, whether specific recommendations were made for preschool children, and other relevant comments in the appraisal documentation. Deciding which appraisals to include was a subjective process, and therefore two researchers (AL and AM) independently assessed whether appraisals should be included, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.\\n\\nWe also identified how many appraisals included infants (defined as children under one) and examined whether improved HRQoL evidence specifically for this age group would be likely to be important in the context of the appraisal.\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\n3.1. Included Appraisals and Summary of Results\\n\\nA total of 29 appraisals whose population included children under five were identified. A total of 12 topics, comprising six TAs and six HSTs, were included in the final analysis set (see Figure 1).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In NICE’s standard single technology appraisal process, the company is responsible for identifying the evidence to inform the health state utility values used in the economic model. This evidence may come from data collected in the company’s trials or from the literature (preferably from a systematic review). The ERG may identify additional evidence during their critique of the company’s submission and suggest alternative utility values. Consequently, the committee may discuss several possible health state utility values. Our analysis focussed on the methods used to calculate the most influential health state utility values in the committee’s preferred model (that is, the model used for decision-making). We identified the measure used to derive utility values, the type of study where the measure was collected and who completed it, and who completed the valuation tasks used to convert response data into utility values. The results are summarised in Table 1.\\n\\n3.2. Measures of HRQoL Used to Derive Health State Utility Values in Models\\n\\nNearly all the included appraisals used a preference-accompanied generic measure of quality of life, in line with the NICE reference case for adult utility values (see Figure 2). In HST11, the committee considered two sets of utility values without deciding which was preferred, so the number of methods sums to 13.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The most common measure used was EQ-5D-3L: either mapped from EQ-5D-5L, n = 6; used directly, n = 2; or general population values with utility decrements calculated from the HUI, n = 2. In one appraisal where the company performed mapping from EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L (HST11), the committee also considered utility values from a disease-specific preference-accompanied measure identified by the ERG. One appraisal (TA630) included pooled data from multiple measures (EQ-5D-5L and PedsQL) mapped to EQ-5D-3L. HUI3 was used directly in TA566 because the condition involved hearing loss, where the HUI may be more sensitive than EQ-5D [20]. One appraisal (TA588) used direct elicitation of utility values from experts. It should be noted that this was not the initial approach proposed by either the company or ERG, but was an attempt to resolve differences in opinion around the face validity of utility values proposed in certain health states in the model.\\n\\nWe also examined supplementary evidence that did not inform the economic model. Evidence from generic measures of quality of life designed for either preschool children or older children was identified by either the company or ERG in eight of the 12 appraisals. However, many of these measures are not preference-accompanied (or do not have UK value sets). Only one generic measure (PedsQL) was identified in more than one appraisal, indicating a lack of strong preference for the use of any single measure designed for children. Evidence from disease-specific measures was only identified in one TA but was common in HST evaluations, with four of the six evaluations identifying evidence from such measures.\\n\\n3.3. Who Is Completing the Measure and in What Kind of Study?'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Across these diverse appraisals, one unifying factor is that the utility values were rarely based on evidence directly from preschool children or their parents or guardians. These data were only presented in three of the 12 included appraisals (25%) and even in these cases did not necessarily cover the full population being evaluated, as can be seen in Table 1 for TA566. Instead, preschool utility values usually relied on data from studies including adults or older children with the condition (in the case of TAs) or the interpretation of health states by clinical experts (in the case of HSTs). The main reason companies gave for the use of adult data is that limited (or no) HRQoL data were available for preschool children. On some occasions, companies advised that the model was not suitable for use in a paediatric population or that inclusion of separate utilities for young children would overcomplicate the model.\\n\\nThe data sources used by HSTs and TAs are distinct and therefore it is informative to consider these separately (see Figure 3). The majority of HST evaluations (4/6) used ‘vignette’ studies, where respondents were given descriptions of the health states in the model and were asked to complete a questionnaire (usually the EQ-5D-5L or 3L) based on these descriptions. In all cases, the questionnaires were completed by clinicians experienced in treating the condition. One appraisal (HST2) used data from a burden of illness survey completed by children, adults and parents or guardians of young children, but only the values from adults were used in the economic model. The remaining appraisal (HST7) derived health state utilities by applying utility decrements to EQ-5D general population norms. These utility decrements were based on literature data for adverse effects in other conditions, which were considered suitable proxies for the condition being appraised.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Only three TAs used utility values derived from studies which included preschool children. However, there were limitations to the approach used in each of these. This paper does not report full details of who completed the measure because these data either were not reported in the company submission or were marked as confidential by the company. In one appraisal (TA630), data from children aged under 2 years old were excluded because there was no suitable mapping algorithm available to convert responses from the PedsQL infant scale to EQ-5D-3L values. One further TA (TA566) had two distinct clinical populations, one of which used data from studies including preschool children and the other data from adults only. Finally, TA538 used utility decrements derived from the HUI, which requires use of a non-UK value set. Of the three remaining TAs, two used data from studies which included adults only and one used directly elicited expert clinical opinion.\\n\\nIn the included TAs, most health state utility values were derived from observational studies identified in the literature (4/6). Only one appraisal (TA630) used utility values derived from the pivotal clinical study of the intervention (in this case a single-arm trial). In TA588, the health state utility values used in the company’s final model were based on direct elicitation from experts, as discussed above.\\n\\n3.4. How the Measures Were Valued'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Two-thirds of appraisals in the analysis (8/12) used the UK EQ-5D-3L value set to generate utility values from questionnaire response data. This means that the valuation task was performed by adult members of the UK general public, although in one case (HST11) the committee also considered data from a disease-specific measure valued by members of the general public in several countries including the UK. In one appraisal (TA151) the health states were derived using a sample of UK diabetes patients who completed time trade-off valuation tasks. Utility values derived from the general public of other countries were used in two appraisals; in one case (TA566) because the HUI3, which has no UK value set, was used as the utility measure; and in the other (TA300) because the EQ-5D data from other countries were based on a larger sample size and were more recent than the available UK data. In the second case, the committee noted that it would have preferred UK data, but felt that its availability would not have significantly altered the conclusions of the cost-effectiveness analysis. The remaining appraisal (TA588) used utility scores directly elicited from experts.\\n\\n3.5. Themes from Committee Conclusions'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='NICE appraisal committees are aware that “identifying robust utility values in babies and young children is exceptionally challenging” (TA588). We identified several themes from the committee conclusions in the final appraisal documentation of the 12 included appraisals. The main themes identified (present in three or more appraisals) were: a lack of or limitations in the quality of life data (9/12, 75%), high uncertainty in the utility values (5/12, 42%), health-related benefits which were not captured by the utility values (5/12, 42%), that the utility values used were appropriate or likely to be the best available (4/12, 33%), that the approach of using adult values was not appropriate/validated (3/12, 25%) and that the committee would have preferred to have seen utility values based on clinical trial data (3/12, 25%). In the four appraisals where adult data were exclusively used to generate utility values, the committee only indicated that these data were suitable on a single occasion, otherwise stating that such an approach was either unsuitable or not validated. All three instances of the committee stating a preference for trial data are from HSTs where the company had also presented vignette studies, indicating committee concerns around the limitations of vignette studies even in the context of very rare conditions and a young patient population.\\n\\nWhen committees indicated that health-related benefits were not captured in the utility values they took this into account in their decision making. For example, in TA566 the committee noted that bilateral cochlear implants may increase opportunities for interaction and communication for deaf children. This includes opportunities to participate in play activities, and benefits from education, which were unlikely to be captured in the cost-effectiveness model because it used utility values derived from adults.\\n\\n3.6. Appraisals including Infants'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Several appraisals included technologies with marketing authorisations which include infants (defined here as children under one). For the technologies where infants were likely to receive treatment 4/6 included them in the economic model (see Figure 4). In two of these appraisals gains in QALYs are likely to be driven by life extension rather than quality of life (meaning the QALYs gained in early life are likely to be a small proportion of the total QALYs gained for life-saving interventions, see case study of HST6 below). In the remaining two appraisals it is plausible that HRQoL evidence generated specifically for babies and infants may influence the results, but the extent of any impact is unclear and may be small compared with other uncertainties in the evidence base.\\n\\n4. Case Study: Differences across the Preschool Age Range\\n\\nOne of the challenges of measuring HRQoL for preschool children is that different considerations may apply at different ages due to a young child’s rapid development and/or a condition where the disease course is age dependent. An illustrative example is HST6, asfotase alfa for treating paediatric-onset hypophosphatasia. Hypophosphatasia is a genetic condition which disrupts the mineralisation process, where calcium and phosphorus are deposited in bones and teeth. Hypophosphatasia leads to a range of symptoms including rickets, weakening of the bones, bone deformity and fractures. There are several clinical forms depending on the age of onset of the condition, and people who present with perinatal- or infantile-onset hypophosphatasia (onset in the first six months of life) have a high mortality rate.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Asfotase alfa is a targeted enzyme replacement therapy designed to restore the regulation of metabolic processes in the bones and teeth, and to reduce complications associated with hypophosphatasia. The committee noted asfotase alfa is a life-saving intervention for infants, whereas for children diagnosed above one year of age, the main benefit of treatment is improving quality of life rather than length of life. This influenced the economic modelling: including infants in the model led to a larger gain in the total number of quality-adjusted life years for children treated with asfotase alfa. This gain was largely driven by an increase in life years gained, that is the number of QALYs gained because of improved quality of live in the first year of life is very small compared with QALYs gained from additional years of survival; therefore, the model’s estimated utility values for the first year of life cannot substantially affect the results.\\n\\nThe committee concluded that “the benefits of asfotase alfa in people with perinatal- and infantile-onset hypophosphatasia were of a different nature to those in the older groups, and that they were also both the largest and the least uncertain in this population group” and took this into account when making its decision. In this example, additional data on quality of life for infants would not substantially influence the cost-effectiveness estimates because the results are driven by life years gained rather than quality of life. In contrast, if better data on quality of life were available for children aged older than one year this may have reduced uncertainty in the modelling of the older preschool age groups. For example, quality of life data in this model were obtained by having clinicians complete vignette studies. NICE’s proposed updated methods expresses a preference for data from clinical trials—or, if vignettes must be used, for them to be scored by members of the public, parents/guardians or carers.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Asfotase alfa was recommended for use with a managed access agreement. In addition to providing the treatment with a discount and agreeing data collection to reduce some of the uncertainties in the evidence base, the managed access agreement also set out the patient population which would be eligible to receive alfotase alfa. Infants diagnosed with hypophosphatasia are automatically eligible for treatment. For older children (where there are greater uncertainties in the evidence base), there are several stopping and starting criteria, one of which is quality of life as measured by the PedsQL scale. This highlights that having a reliable way to measure the quality of life of young children is not just a niche concern of economic modelling, but also has important clinical uses and may be employed in managed access agreements. It is therefore important that the psychometric properties and feasibility of measures designed for preschool children are evaluated with all these potential uses in mind.\\n\\n5. Discussion\\n\\nHTA agencies such as NICE are responsible for evaluating treatments for preschool children, and these are among the most challenging, emotive and controversial appraisals that they do. Our review found a high proportion of NICE HSTs and a small proportion of TAs include preschool children. An informal analysis of upcoming TA and HST topics shows that the number including preschool children is either steady or slightly increasing over the next few years. Thus, this age group should not be ignored in research into methods of measuring and valuing health-related quality of life.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Gathering good-quality data on health-related quality of life is challenging for all children [21,22], but doing so for preschool children brings its own unique difficulties [23]. The developmental changes from birth to five years are incredibly rapid [24,25]. Furthermore, because young children are unable to complete questionnaires themselves, these must be completed by proxy. FDA and ISPOR taskforce recommendations state that the focus of questionnaires should be on “observable” outcomes to minimise the influence of subjective judgements made by the proxy [26,27]. However, these recommendations were written from the perspective of the data required for licensing. From an HTA perspective, there is concern that focussing on “observable” outcomes may mean that the measure focuses on physical functioning and does not capture all elements of HRQoL which are important to the child. Further research into how these non-observable elements could best be captured by proxy reports may be valuable, but the research would need to involve decision-makers to consider whether the broader information on quality of life was sufficiently valid and reliable. Another challenge is that it is not possible to fully separate the influence of the carer-child dyad upon each other [28,29,30,31]. A seriously unwell child is likely to negatively affect the parent’s health-related quality of life, and vice versa.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Given these difficulties, and the lack of consensus on best practice in the academic literature [21,22,23], it is perhaps not surprising that NICE does not have explicit guidance on measuring and valuing health-related quality of life in preschool children (whilst we have not conducted an exhaustive review, we do not believe other HTA agencies do, either). The present review found that almost all NICE appraisals in this age group used a preference-accompanied generic measure of quality of life, typically EQ-5D. None of the measures used in these appraisals has been demonstrated to be suitable for use in preschool children, so their validity, reliability and sensitivity in this age group are unknown. Regarding who completed the measure, for HSTs, the most common approach was to gather data from clinical experts who read vignettes of health states; for TAs the data often came entirely or primarily from adults with the condition. This difference probably reflects the paucity of data to inform typical HST evaluations, because the conditions are very rare, because adult patients may not be similar to child patients, and in some cases because there is little adult data to extrapolate from as patients may not survive into adulthood.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Our review reveals that committees were frequently concerned about limitations in the quality of life data and the resulting uncertainty in the utility values. Although the sample is small, two conclusions emerge. First, committees would prefer to see data from children or their parents and guardians, rather than just from adults with the condition or clinical experts. Second, HST committees would prefer to see data from clinical trials rather than vignettes alone. This latter finding indicates that, while there may be limitations of utility values derived from clinical trials for rare disease which include preschool children, committees would find it useful to see such data alongside vignette studies to inform their conclusions on the validity of and uncertainty around the utility values used in the economic model. Overall, and by necessity, NICE committees take a pragmatic approach and weigh up all the available evidence in a process of deliberative decision-making.\\n\\nOur review only identified a small number of appraisals where babies and infants were included in the economic model and in half of these it was judged that mortality was the main driver of QALY gains. We speculate that even when quality of life is a key driver of the model, the time period from birth to first birthday is so short and the challenge of gathering HRQoL data so substantial that committees may well be content to use data from slightly older children to inform utility values for infants. Thus, on balance, research into methods designed for infants could currently be less of a priority for NICE than research into methods for children over the age of one.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Proposed changes to the NICE methods guide [32,33,34] do not focus on preschool children. Nonetheless, the proposed update provides more direction on relevant methods than has been available previously, including (a) Support for measuring the health-related quality of life of children and young people using a generic measure—provided it has good psychometric performance in the relevant age range(s).\\n\\n(b) Support for clearer reporting of who is completing the measures and how it is valued. Proxy reporting should be by carers rather than professionals.\\n\\n(c) A hierarchy of preferred methods for measuring health-related quality of life, including advice on when disease-specific measures may be considered. The draft methods guide states “If there is evidence that generic measures are unsuitable for the condition or intervention, refer to the hierarchy of preferred sources for health-related quality of life.” [34] The hierarchy also includes general information on the design and conduct of vignette studies which is applicable to young children [35,36].\\n\\nSuggested research priorities include:(a) Research on the psychometric properties of generic measures when applied to this age group (for example; known-group validity, content validity, face validity, reliability and responsiveness). Candidate measures include those initially designed for older children and those specifically designed for the under-five’s, for example several have been identified in systematic reviews [37,38,39] or have been recently published [40].\\n\\n(b) Research into the feasibility and validity of valuation studies of those measures.\\n\\n(c) Research into the feasibility and validity of mapping from measures used in preschool children onto measures intended for older children or adults (this may be useful if the population includes a mix of preschool and older children).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The key strengths of this study are that it provides a comprehensive overview of NICE technology evaluations of preschool children over the past 16 years. Quantitative data were supplemented by an exploration of the rationale behind the choice of utility values and the committee’s critique of these data. Key limitations are a small sample size and a focus on NICE technology evaluations. Thus, we cannot know whether our conclusions are generalisable to other countries or to clinical guidelines.\\n\\n6. Conclusions\\n\\nThis study examined the methods and data sources used to generate utility values for NICE evaluations of preschool children. We found a reliance on data from adults or from clinical experts. Even when data on the quality of life of preschool children were collected, the instruments used were not validated in this population. These limitations reflect a shortage of age-appropriate measures and a lack of consensus about best-practice methods for this age group. However, this paper is not a counsel of despair. NICE committees are well accustomed to being presented with uncertain evidence, and their deliberative approach ensures that limitations in evidence and methods are not a barrier to patients accessing innovative treatments. Nonetheless, there is room for improvement, and we highlight key areas for further research. Progress in these areas will help ensure that the aspects of quality of life which matter to young children and their families are captured in NICE evaluations.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation, A.L. and R.L.; methodology, A.L.; formal analysis, A.L. and A.M.; data curation, A.L. and A.M.; writing—original draft preparation, A.L.; writing—review and editing, R.L. and A.M.

Approximately one third of epileptic patients are resistant to antiepileptic drugs and therefore require alternative therapeutic options. Dietary and nutritional supplements can in some cases replace drugs, but with the exception of ketogenic diets, there are no officially recommended dietary considerations for patients with epilepsy. In this review we summarize a selection of nutritional suggestions that have proved beneficial in treating different types of epilepsy. We describe the types of seizures and epilepsy and follow this with an introduction to basic molecular mechanisms. We then examine several functional nutrients for which there is clinical evidence of therapeutic efficacy in reducing seizures or epilepsy-associated sudden death. We also discuss experimental results that demonstrate possible molecular mechanisms elicited by the administration of various nutrients. The availability of multiple dietary and nutritional candidates that show favorable outcomes in animals implies that assessing the clinical potential of these substances will improve translational medicine, ultimately benefitting epilepsy patients.'),\n",

Introduction\\nEpilepsy is a common neurological disease with a prevalence of approximately 0.4 to 1% which affects people of all ages and races, and both genders [1]. It is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a variety of etiologic backgrounds associated with seizure manifestation [2]. Germline or somatic mutations; structural brain lesions including stroke, cancer, trauma, and status epilepticus; various infections; metabolic defects; and autoimmune-mediated dysregulation of inflammation can all elicit seizures, which range from altered sensation of the five senses to rapid head and eye movement to brief or prolonged loss of consciousness to uncontrolled muscle contractions and spasms [1,3]. Vigorous efforts to delineate different types of epilepsy in a more precise manner and to treat patients using antiepileptic drugs with appropriate mechanisms of action have made great progress in suppressing unexpected seizures. Some 70% of epilepsy patients now exercise seizure management [1]. However, for the remaining 30%, who suffer from intractable epilepsy, treatment options are limited to different multi-drug therapies or surgery if applicable. Alternative treatments for patients with refractory epilepsy are therefore needed.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Functional foods and bioactive nutrients can be considered part of adjunctive therapy or an essential strategy for the treatment of epilepsy, depending on the etiologic nature [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. For certain metabolic epilepsies, supplying deficient nutrients can correct inborn errors and stop seizures [20], while for most refractory epilepsies, no obvious effective dietary recommendations are available other than ketogenic diets [21,22]. To provide comprehensive information about nutritional supplements for the treatment of epilepsy, we summarize here functional nutrients that have shown therapeutic efficacy in drug-refractory epilepsy. First, we provide an overview of epilepsy and its essential molecular mechanisms. We then summarize a selection of biologically active nutrients that can be used as add-on or first-line therapy for intractable epilepsies, based on PubMed search criteria with combinations of keywords including “nutrient”, “functional food”, “nutrition”, “nutritional”, “dietary supplement”, “supplementation”, “vitamin”, “mineral”, “fatty acids”, “epilepsy”, “epilepsy syndrome”, “refractory epilepsy”, “intractable epilepsy”, “drug-resistant epilepsy”, “temporal lobe epilepsy”, “genetic generalized epilepsy”, and “metabolic epilepsy”, etc. Finally, we discuss the experimental evidence supporting the clinical findings.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n2. General Overview of Epilepsy \\n2.1. Classification of Seizures\\nA variety of factors can elicit the transient, synchronous, and excessive neuronal activities that cause seizures. Because current knowledge is not yet sufficient to distinguish between various types of seizures based on etiology, seizures are classified by their mode of onset, degree of awareness, and initial symptoms. In the latest classification released by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 2017 (Figure 1), seizure types are divided into three groups: focal onset, generalized onset, and unknown onset [23]. Focal and generalized seizures are classified by where and how seizure activity begins. For example, focal onset seizures are localized in discrete areas of the brain, usually in one hemisphere, whereas generalized onset seizures immediately engage bilaterally-distributed networks of the brain. For focal seizures, the level of awareness can be further described to display seizure characteristics, in addition to the first prominent sign such as motor symptoms (automatisms, atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, hyperkinetic, myoclonic, tonic) or non-motor symptoms (autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, sensory). Finally, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are categorized as focal seizures when an initial seizure focus is identifiable. Generalized onset seizures can be divided into motor or non-motor (absence) seizures. Depending on the clinical diagnostic observations, motor seizures can be further classified as tonic-clonic, clonic, tonic, myoclonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic, myoclonic-atonic, atonic, and epileptic spasms, while non-motor seizures can be categorized as typical, atypical, myoclonic, and eyelid myoclonia. Seizures of unknown onset can be described as “unclassified” or with additional characteristics such as motor (tonic-clonic or epileptic spasms) or non-motor (behavior arrest) symptoms. However, if seizure onset can be determined at a later time, seizures of unknown onset can be re-categorized as either focal or generalized seizures. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n2.2. Classification of Epilepsy\\nEpilepsy has been defined as the experience of at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 h apart. However, ILAE has revised the definition of epilepsy, providing wider diagnostic criteria that include additional conditions: (1) one unprovoked seizure and a 60% or greater probability of further seizures occurring over the next 10 years, which is similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures; (2) a diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome [2]. As epilepsy includes heterogeneous encephalopathies sharing a common symptom, namely, seizures, continuous efforts to categorize epilepsies based on their characteristics have been made [3,24]. The revised classification proposes three levels of diagnostic steps with an additional two factors (Figure 2) [3]. The first level involves determining seizure types that have been described in the previous section. Once the seizure types can be classified with clinical tools, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) and proper imaging modalities, the epilepsy types can be further determined. The four groupings for the second level classification of epilepsies are focal, generalized, combined generalized and focal, and unknown. Focal epilepsies generally show abnormal EEG activity in one hemisphere, whereas generalized epilepsies show generalized spike-wave activity in both hemispheres. However, epilepsy can include multiple types of seizures. For instance, generalized epilepsy can manifest as tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonic jerks. The third diagnostic level involves evaluating whether a patient’s epilepsy can be recognized as a distinctive clinical disorder, i.e., epilepsy syndrome. Although there is no official ILAE list of epilepsy syndromes, Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastraut syndrome, Lindau-Kleffner syndrome, childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone, Rasmussen syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis, self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, self-limited occipital epilepsies of childhood, and Panayiotopoulos syndrome can be included within epilepsy syndrome, and are differentially classified based on the age of onset, seizure triggers, and diurnal variation, together with EEG and imaging findings.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The type of epilepsy can be further specified by etiological implication, which can be of structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, or unknown etiology. Structural abnormalities such as stroke-induced infarction, trauma, hippocampal sclerosis, and hypothalamic hamartoma are associated with an increased risk of being epileptic. Brain lesions visualized by imaging tools can also identify candidate surgical areas for the treatment of acquired epilepsy. As basic epilepsy research and genetic screening techniques have improved more than 400 genetic mutations associated with epilepsy have been identified, including SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A, SCN9A, SCN1B, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCTD7, CACNA1H, CLCN2, GABRA1, GABRB3, GABRG2, SLC2A1, CDKL5, ARX, CHD2, STXBP1, and PNPO [25,26,27]. “Genetic” does not mean “inherited,” as both germline and de novo mutations can cause epilepsy. Diverse infectious organisms can cause epilepsy, and these forms are different from seizures originating from simple acute meningitis or encephalitis. Examples include neurocysticercosis, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cerebral malaria, cerebral toxoplasmosis, and congenital Zika or cytomegalovirus infections. Metabolic epilepsy refers to metabolic diseases that manifest unprovoked seizures. Most metabolic epilepsies, such as porphyria, uremia, aminoacidopathies, and pyridoxine deficiency, have a genetic basis, but acquired metabolic epilepsy, i.e., cerebral folate deficiency, also exists. Epilepsies with immunological backgrounds have increased due to the advancement of immunological tests that utilize numerous antibodies. Such epilepsies are essentially variants of autoimmune encephalitis, including anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor encephalitis or anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated-1 (LGI1) encephalitis, in which autoantibodies for autoantigens elicit excessive inflammation in the brain.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The final diagnostic step is the consideration of comorbidities associated with epilepsy. Frequently listed abnormalities include learning and memory impairment, mood disturbance, autism spectrum disorders, and psychosocial issues. However, as epilepsies cover a range of seizure-related disorders, more severe comorbidities that can cause permanent sequelae such as cerebral palsy, gait disturbance, or developmental delay can also be observed. Accurate categorization will therefore be essential for the comprehensive treatment and better understanding of the complex nature of epilepsy.\\n\\n3. Molecular Mechanisms of Epilepsy\\nAn imbalance between excitation and inhibition has long been thought to be one of the main mechanisms that cause spontaneous seizures, based on the classical channelopathy model of epilepsy [27,28]. Single-nucleotide mutations such as missense, frameshift and nonsense mutations, copy number variations by de novo or inherited DNA deletion or duplication, and chromosomal copy number abnormalities can cause genetic epilepsies [29]. However, acquired epilepsy (i.e., TLE) can develop from the initial insult and subsequent accumulation of multiple structural changes that promote network excitabilities, ultimately ending in spontaneous recurrent seizures [28]. In addition, rapid technological advancements in gene panel screening and next-generation sequencing for both genetic and acquired epilepsies have identified several new molecular candidates that do not appear to have a direct link with network hyperexcitability [25,29,30]. Emerging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are much more complicated than expected, prompting demand for more vigorous research. In this review, we discuss three basic mechanisms that are commonly observed in both genetic and acquired epilepsies.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.1. Ion Channel and Neurotransmitter Dynamics in Epilepsy\\nMany voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels are dysregulated in epilepsies caused by both genetic mutations and structural abnormalities [26,27,31]. Active exome sequencing can uncover a variety of mutations in sodium, potassium, and calcium channel genes, in addition to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and NMDA receptor genes [26,27]. We will cover the critical facts concerning some exemplary channel mutations in this review; for more detailed information, refer to [26,27]. Voltage-dependent sodium channels such as SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A, SCN9A, and SCN1B, which encode Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Navβ1, respectively, have had many different mutation sites reported for each gene, including both nonsense and missense mutations [26]. This may explain why patients with the same mutation can exhibit variable seizure severity. Moreover, as multiple DNA regions can be mutated within the same gene, it is likely that the SCN1A mutation can be identified in multiple kinds of genetic epilepsies, including severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, and partial epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. Although the details of the sodium channel dysfunction differ depending on the individual mutation site, overall changes are made toward channel hyperactivity, promoting neuronal hyperexcitation [32,33,34,35]. This explanation is supported by knockout animals showing seizure phenotypes [36,37,38,39,40]. Finally, SCN1A and SCN8A mutations have been associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although the etiologic mechanisms behind SUDEP are unclear, the association between refractory seizures by SCN1A and SCN8A mutations and disrupted cardiorespiratory function has been proposed as a risk factor for SUDEP [34,41,42,43,44,45].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='With regard to potassium channels, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations are frequently observed in patients with self-limited familial neonatal seizures [46]. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode voltage-gated potassium channels that produce the M current, inducing a hyperpolarizing shift in membrane voltage. Loss of their function can increase neuronal hyperexcitability, leading to spontaneous seizure activities as reported in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 knockout mice [47]. Among calcium channel mutations, CACNA1H, a T-type calcium channel subunit called Cav3.2, has shown three missense mutations in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy and has displayed enhanced channel function [48,49]. As for ligand-gated ion channels such as GABAA and glutamate NMDA receptors, GABRA1, GABRB3, and GABRG2 mutations encoding α1, β3, and γ2 subunits of GABAA receptor, and GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, and GRIN2D mutations encoding NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and NR2D subunits of NMDA receptors, respectively, have been identified in genetic epilepsy [27]. Similarly to the other channel mutations described above, most mutations of GABAA receptors cause loss of function, whereas mutations of NMDA receptors induce the gain of function of NMDA receptors [27], anticipating network hyperexcitability in these genetic epilepsies.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Ion channel abnormalities have also been examined extensively in acquired epilepsy, including TLE [31]. In general, individual perturbations of many different ion channels occur toward the facilitation of network hyperexcitability. For example, transcription of the T-type calcium channel Cav3.2 was shown to be upregulated after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus [50], which can change the mode of neuronal firing from regular to intrinsic burst firing after acute seizures [51,52], strengthening the propensity of neuronal excitation. Other important players mediating abnormal neuronal transmission in TLE are ligand-gated GABA and glutamate receptors. Failure of GABAergic inhibition contributes to the development of epilepsy [53,54]. It may accompany enhanced excitatory transmission by molecular re-assembly of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunits, as GluR2 transcription has been shown to decrease after status epilepticus [55], suggesting a possible increase in calcium permeability through this receptor [56]. Alterations of GABAA receptor subtypes in TLE can also participate in compensation of the seizure-induced imbalance between excitation and inhibition, contributing to complex epileptogenesis [57].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.2. Oxidative Stress in Epilepsy\\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) contain unpaired electrons. Common free radicals generated in cells include superoxides, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide. These ROS can be produced as a byproduct of physiological mitochondrial respiration [58] or the activation of cellular enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase, xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase [59]. Numerous experimental studies have reported excessive ROS production in epilepsies that exceeds the capability of endogenous antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and thioredoxin reductases [60]. The resulting oxidative stress after seizure activities can lead to peroxidation of cellular macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. These alterations undermine cellular function in general because protein oxidation can change the structure and activity of crucial enzymes such as sodium-potassium ATPase [61]. ROS-induced alteration of sodium-potassium ATPase can then impair the efficient reversal of neuronal depolarization-induced electrochemical gradients, causing excitotoxicity. In addition, peroxidation can alter the properties of lipid bilayers, influencing membrane permeability and the activity of membrane proteins, including ion channels, and ligand-gated neurotransmitter receptors [62]. Together, excessive ROS-mediated oxidative stress induced by seizures can predispose neuronal hyperexcitability.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Some genetic epilepsies exhibit mitochondrial DNA mutations affecting complex I of an electron transport chain [63,64]. Intractable myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) and Leigh syndrome have displayed increased ROS production due to complex I dysfunction [65,66]. When the MERRF gene is mutated, impairments of mitochondrial calcium uptake and ATP synthesis, which can trigger cellular energy deficiency-initiated neuronal excitotoxicity, are observed [67]. Moreover, a thioredoxin reductase 1 mutation reported in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy can increase sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide challenges [68], implying insufficient ROS detoxification. Another study has identified patients with Lafora disease as showing progressive myoclonic epilepsy and the mutation of glucan phosphatases EPM2A and EPM2B [69,70]. Fibroblasts obtained from Lafora disease patients have been shown to exhibit increased production of ROS, including mitochondrial superoxide, along with a reduction in mitochondrial SOD and catalase expression [70]. This has been further supported by both EPM2A and EPM2B knockout mice exhibiting reduced SOD activity in addition to increased levels of lipid peroxidation, suggesting defective cellular processes that reduce oxidative stress by genetic mutations. These pieces of evidence collectively support the idea of elevated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of various genetic epilepsies.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In acquired epilepsy syndromes, multiple reports have consistently shown that seizures induce oxidative damage following excessive ROS generation in the brain, exacerbating network excitability [59,60,71]. Various markers of protein and lipid peroxidation have been reportedly increased in surgically-resected human TLE tissues [72,73,74,75], despite upregulated glutathione and SOD antioxidant systems [73,76,77], suggesting seizure-induced oxidative damage. Animal studies have also confirmed increased ROS production in the hippocampus in association with oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and mitochondrial DNA [78,79,80,81,82,83]. A cause-and-effect relationship between oxidative stress and the development of epilepsy has been suggested by reports that spontaneous recurrent seizures in SOD mutant mice are correlated with augmented oxidative damage and neuronal death due to insufficient antioxidant expression [84,85]. In summary, these results emphasize the important role of oxidative stress in epileptogenesis and related neuropathology.\\n\\n3.3. Inflammation in Epilepsy\\nThe majority of genetic-epilepsy-associated genes studied to date involve ion channels and a few strands of mitochondrial DNA. Little has been reported with respect to inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. However, two papers investigating single-nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in patients with febrile seizures have raised the possibility of de novo mutations [86,87]. They found that IL-1β TT genotypes were over-represented in febrile seizure–experiencing groups compared with healthy controls. Moreover, serum IL-1β concentration was significantly higher in patients experiencing febrile seizures, suggesting that an IL-1β polymorphism may promote proinflammatory conditions after febrile seizures and contribute to the development of TLE in a chronic phase.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the hippocampus, activation of astrocytes and microglia has been consistently observed after acute seizures in multiple types of epilepsy, including TLE, tuberous sclerosis complex, traumatic brain injury, Rasmussen syndrome, and focal cortical dysplasia [88,89]. Activated glial cells can release various inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), COX-2, and complementary factors after acute seizures [90]. Glial cells respond rapidly to seizure activities as cytokine levels in the brain increase within 30 min of seizure onset and stay at high levels even in chronic epileptic stages [88]. With regard to the many inflammatory mediators released in epileptogenic brains, the pro-epileptic roles of IL-1β are well established. Upregulated IL-1β and its inhibition by interleukin 1 receptor agonist have been found to facilitate and alleviate the induction of status epilepticus, respectively, with the regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission [91,92]. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines increase blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, supporting dynamic relationships among BBB breakdown, inflammation, and reactive glial activation [91]. HMGB1, another pro-epileptic mediator that can be secreted by glial cells and dead neurons, acts through a toll-like receptor (TLR) system [93]. Increased expression of HMGB1 and TLR4 is seen in TLE and focal cortical dysplasia [93]; HMGB1 can enhance both acute and chronic seizure susceptibilities in a TLR4-dependent manner [94].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='IL-6 can be anti-epileptic, and, as experimental and clinical evidence has shown, it is involved in glutamatergic receptor-mediated acute seizure aggravation [95,96]. However, TNF-α can serve either pro- or anti-epileptic roles, depending on the context. For example, TNF-α infusion into the lateral ventricle can increase seizure susceptibility [97], supporting the pro-epileptogenic effects of TNF-α. Moreover, TNF-α has demonstrated a pro-convulsive effect involving activation of TNF-α receptor 1 but an opposite anti-ictogenic effect has also been observed when TNF-α signaling is mediated by TNF-α receptor 2 [98]. In support of the anticonvulsive effects of TNF-α signaling pathways, knockout of TNF-α and its receptor p75 using a genetic approach has shown exacerbated seizures with aggravated cell death [99]. \\n\\nMultiple proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators secreted by activated glial cells can play multifaceted roles in various types of epilepsy, affecting the network excitability. As their modes of action are complex and intricate, a deeper appreciation of the underlying mechanism will provide valuable insights into the complicated pathophysiology of epilepsy. \\n\\n4. Functional Nutrients Beneficial in Epilepsy\\nA variety of nutritional interventions have been carried out in patients with epilepsy to investigate the clinical significance of functional nutrients in the control of seizures. Despite ample experimental evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of various nutrients, clinical data assessing the anticonvulsive effects of nutritional supplements are scarce. In this section we introduce several nutrients that have demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple clinical studies and explore their possible molecular mechanisms.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4.1. Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids\\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. They must therefore be obtained from the diet or supplements. Marine fish (salmon, tuna, and mackerel), nuts and seeds (flaxseed, chia seeds, almonds, and walnuts) are rich in dietary n-3 PUFAs [100]. The three major omega-3 fatty acids are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are found mainly in marine fish oils, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is the main component of plant oils. Among these three, DHA is the primary n-3 PUFA in the brain and constitutes 10–20% of total brain fatty acids, whereas ALA and EPA constitute less than 1% [101]. DHA can serve as a structural component of neuronal membranes, modulating membrane biophysical properties [102], ion channel functions [103], and neurotransmitter signaling [104].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The therapeutic benefits of omega-3 fatty acids for epilepsy have been anticipated, as n-3 PUFA can reduce cardiac arrhythmia, which involves the hyperexcitability of cardiac cells [105]. The first clinical, open-label study of the therapeutic potential of fish oil in patients with epilepsy found an anticonvulsive effect associated with n-3 PUFA [4]. However, subsequent clinical studies have produced more controversial results (Table 1). For example, while some randomized clinical trials have found that consuming approximately 0.6–2 g of fish oil reduces seizure frequency and duration [5,6,7,8,9], other small-scale, non-randomized studies have reported no regulatory efficacy for seizures [10,106,107,108,109]. Despite several animal studies suggesting omega-3 fatty acids suppress seizures, whether n-3 PUFA has significant benefits regarding the control of seizures remains unclear. Still, considering the goal of identifying nutritional supplements that assist drug therapy, and given the established safety of fish oil at dosages of less than 4 g per day, fish oil can be recommended for the regulation of seizure generation [110].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A consequential issue in addition to seizure control is SUDEP, a leading cause of death in patients with intractable epilepsy [111,112]. Based on the strong beneficial roles of n-3 PUFAs in the attenuation of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death [105,113], it is plausible that fish oil may promote cardiac health. Many researchers have tried to link n-3 PUFA to the prevention of SUDEP via the reduction of cardiac arrhythmias [114,115,116,117]. A randomized double-blind study assessing 11 patients with intractable epilepsy provided initial evidence that fish oil supplementation could restore heart rate variability (HRV) in a subgroup with very low baseline HRV, which can be a marker of sudden death risk [10]. However, as this is the only study implicating n-3 PUFA supplementation in SUDEP prevention, more efforts are warranted before drawing conclusions regarding the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in epilepsy-associated mortality.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='An elevated seizure threshold associated with n-3 PUFAs has been verified in a variety of animal models [103,118,119,120,121,122,123,124]. With regard to the possible underlying molecular mechanisms of n-3 PUFA-mediated anticonvulsive effects, the regulation of ion channel activities, as well as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, has been proposed. For example, PUFAs can inactivate neuronal voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels [125,126]. Moreover, DHA, ALA, and EPA treatment of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons reportedly facilitates the opening of potassium M-channels, dampening neuronal activity [127]. DHA can also modulate ionotropic GABAA receptors, alleviating neuronal hyperactivities [104,128,129,130]. Increasing inhibitory potentials by n-3 PUFA-associated ion channel modulation can result in improved survival of GABAergic interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as n-3 PUFAs may stabilize seizure-induced hyperexcitable states [131,132]. Another possible mechanism is the anti-oxidative effect of omega-3 fatty acids. Using the pentylenetetrazole model of epilepsy, several researchers have demonstrated that n-3 PUFA administration increases SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity and expression [122,124,133]. This relationship has been further supported by a different model of epilepsy, reinforcing the anti-oxidative function of n-3 PUFAs [134]. When a recent randomized clinical trial assessed cytokine levels after 16 weeks of n-3 PUFA treatment, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were found to significantly decrease in the supplemented group compared to the placebo group [9]. In the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, proinflammatory cytokines in the blood of omega-3 fatty acid-treated rats, including IL-1ß, TNF-α, and IL-6,all decreased [135], supporting the anti-inflammatory role of n-3 PUFAs in epilepsy.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4.2. Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol)\\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that comes in multiple forms, including vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). Among these, vitamin D3 is naturally present in animals and can be synthesized by exposure to sunlight. However, vitamin D can also be obtained from dietary sources such as oily fish (cod, swordfish, salmon, tuna, and sardines), dairy products (milk, cheese, and yogurt), meat (beef liver), and mushrooms [136]. Once vitamin D is produced or ingested, the liver converts it to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vitamin D, calcidiol). The kidney then makes the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-[OH]2 vitamin D, calcitriol) [137]. Vitamin D3 maintains bone integrity by promoting the absorption of calcium and phosphorus. In the brain, vitamin D is a neuroactive steroid, acting through nuclear or membrane vitamin D receptors [138]. Functions of vitamin D in the central nervous system include regulation of neurotransmitters, neuronal differentiation, axonal growth, voltage-sensitive calcium channels, neurotrophic factors, and ROS [138], which can affect proper neuronal function.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Several studies have reported that both young and adult patients with epilepsy show vitamin D deficiency in their blood [139,140,141], providing a rationale for giving vitamin D to people with epilepsy. To date, three clinical studies have investigated the effects of vitamin D on seizure control (Table 2) [11,12,13]. The first study recruited 23 epileptic patients who were divided into two experimental groups, with one given 4000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 daily for 28 days and 16,000 IU of vitamin D3 for the next 28 days, followed by an initial observation period, and the other given the placebo first and then 8000 IU of vitamin D3 for each of the 28-day periods [11]. In patients who received vitamin D3, the mean seizure frequency was significantly reduced to 67–71% of that of the baseline, suggesting an anticonvulsive effect. A similar observation has reported in another clinical study in which correction of vitamin D3 deficiency reduced seizure frequency by up to 40% for drug-resistant epilepsy [12]. A recent cross-sectional cohort study which assessed 160 patients with epilepsy, however, has reported conflicting results which have shown no therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D3 on control of seizure generation [13]. More elaborately designed studies with larger sample sizes will be required to resolve question of the anticonvulsive effects of vitamin D3 with regard to epilepsy. \\n\\nBecause vitamin D3 has versatile therapeutic efficacies on cardiovascular diseases [142], vitamin D3 may have an impact on SUDEP [143]. Although there is no direct evidence demonstrating a possible role for vitamin D in SUDEP prevention, one group has reported that vitamin D supplementation can modulate HRV [144,145,146,147], which is frequently lower in patients with drug-refractory epilepsy, a group at high risk of SUDEP [148,149]. This raises the possibility that vitamin D may have therapeutic benefits for the prevention of SUDEP.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Animal models of epilepsy have also indicated anticonvulsive effects from vitamin D treatment [150,151,152,153]. When the vitamin D receptor has been genetically deleted, seizure susceptibility has been significantly augmented in epileptic mice [154]. Possible mechanisms of vitamin-D3-mediated anticonvulsive effects include a reduction in voltage-sensitive calcium channel expression [155,156] via the attenuation of neuronal calcium overload after seizure activities. Vitamin D can also inhibit the generation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which relieves oxidative cellular damage by blocking nitric oxide production [157]. In addition, the immunomodulatory action of vitamin D has been suggested, as vitamin D can suppress various cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-6 [158,159]. We have also reported that an edible mushroom, Hericium erinaceus, in which ergosteol can be converted to vitamin D [160], may protect hippocampal neurons against pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus by decreasing COX-2-expressing glial cells [161]. The idea of the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D has been further supported by a clinical study that reported how concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IFN-inducible protein 10 markedly decreased after co-treatment with vitamins D and B12. In summary, vitamin D appears to be a promising candidate that will complement epilepsy treatment with antiepileptic drugs.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4.3. Vitamin E\\nVitamin E refers to a group of fat-soluble antioxidants [162]. Vitamin E consists of eight vitamer chemicals with similar molecular structures and functions, namely, four tocopherols (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols) and four tocotrienols (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienols). Among these, α-tocopherol is the most biologically active in humans. Vitamin E is found in nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and green leafy vegetables such as spinach and broccoli [162]. Well known for its anti-oxidative role, vitamin E has been associated with versatile health promotion and additive effects in treatments for many diseases, including cardiovascular, hepatic, and Alzheimer’s diseases [163,164,165].\\n\\nFor epileptic patients, 400 IU of daily vitamin E supplementation for three months has been shown to reduce seizure frequency by approximately 60% compared with a placebo group that showed no difference in the number of seizures (Table 3) [14]. Two other clinical studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of chronic vitamin E administration in patients with refractory epilepsy [15,16], supporting the use of vitamin E as an adjunctive therapeutic option for epilepsy. However, the authors of another randomized, double-blind clinical trial have reported that vitamin E supplementation over three months did not affect the occurrence of seizures regardless of the different types of epilepsy (Table 3) [166].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Many studies have found an anticonvulsant effect resulting from vitamin E treatment [167,168,169,170,171]. Administered after status epilepticus, it promotes the restoration of glutamate metabolisms by normalizing seizure-induced inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS), an enzyme that can reduce synaptic glutamate levels [172]. Vitamin E can also inhibit activation of protein kinase C δ [173,174], which can block GS expression [175], leading to the disinhibition of GS and ultimately the reduction of excitotoxicity. Vitamin E treatment can also offer neuroprotective effects against excessive generation of ROS [176], suggesting anti-oxidative effects. Supporting this hypothesis, many studies investigating pre- or co-treatment of vitamin E in animal models of epilepsy have found that vitamin E supplementation can reduce ROS accumulation and attenuate protein and lipid peroxidation [171,173,177,178,179,180]. In relation to inflammation enhanced by acute seizures, vitamin E can downregulate the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α [168,172,177], implying an anti-inflammatory function. \\n\\n4.4. Vitamin B6\\nVitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system [181]. Dietary vitamin B6 is present in fish (tuna and salmon), meat (beef liver, pork, lamb, and chicken), milk products (cheese and yogurt), grains (yeast bread and biscuits), vegetables (carrots, onion, and tomato), and fruits (berry, apple, watermelon, and banana) [181,182]. It has six vitamer chemicals: pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, pyridoxine 5’-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate (PMP), and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). In general, meat-derived vitamin B6 consists of phosphorylated pyridoxal and pyridoxamine, while plant-derived vitamin B6 contains phosphorylated pyridoxine.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Once pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal are transferred to the liver after absorption, these vitamers are phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase to generate PNP, PMP, and PLP, respectively [183,184]. Additional conversion of PNP and PMP to PLP can occur by pyridoxine-5’-phosphate oxidases (PNPO) to produce a circulatory, active form of vitamin B6 in the blood. As pyridoxal is the only vitamin B6 form that can cross the BBB [185], PLP needs to be hydrolyzed to pyridoxal by tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). In the neurons, PLP is regenerated by pyridoxal kinases, meaning it can act as an active co-factor [183]. PLP can play a crucial role in the synthesis of multiple neurotransmitters, including GABA, glycine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine [183]. For example, PLP can convert glutamate to GABA by facilitating the activation of glutamate decarboxylase, suggesting that vitamin B6 deficiency may enhance network excitability in the brain. As we discussed in Section 2.2, pyridoxine deficiency can cause unprovoked seizures which are classified as a type of multifarious epilepsy [3].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Vitamin B6 supplementation has been demonstrated to be beneficial in some, but not all, studies evaluating patients with epilepsy (Table 4). In the 1960s, two clinical studies investigated the effects of vitamin B6 administration on the amelioration of seizures. The researchers found that some patients who received vitamin B6 showed significant clinical improvement, although this was not observed for all patients [17,18]. Later, Jiao and colleagues performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which 30 or 50 mg of pyridoxine infusion could resolve the occurrence of recurrent seizures [19]. The total response rate in the pyridoxine-treated group was 92.5%, a significantly higher rate than the control group. However, other clinical studies involving varying types of epilepsy have failed to illustrate anticonvulsive effects following vitamin B6 treatment [186,187,188]. As all of the clinical studies assessing the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin B6 are small-scale studies interpreting mixed results from various epilepsies, more elaborate studies will be necessary to provide conclusive information about the role of vitamin B6 in epilepsy.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nGenetic epilepsies associated with vitamin B6 deficiency include PNPO deficiency, infantile hypophosphatasia, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, and type II hyperprolinemia [189]. In an attempt to gain molecular insight, PNPO mutations frequently seen in patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy were introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and PNPO activities and subsequent PLP synthesis both declined [190,191], suggesting PNPO-mediated disruption of vitamin B6 synthesis. Infantile hypophosphatasia features a mutation in TNAP, a critical enzyme for the cellular transport of PLP [192]. Indeed, TNAP-deleted mice have displayed increased serum PLP levels due to the reduced availability of cellular PLP and the development of spontaneous seizures with a decrease in total GABA [193]. Moreover, pyridoxine and pyridoxal administration have been found to rescue the seizure phenotype of TNAP mutant mice, providing a molecular mechanism for hypophosphatasia-induced seizures. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is an autosomal recessive disorder with an ALDH7A1 mutation [20,194]. ALDH7A1 encodes α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin, which generates α-aminoadipic acid in the process of lysine catabolism. ALDH7A1 mutation induces antiquitin deficiency, which results in elevated levels of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde [194,195]. This can further promote the accumulation of piperidine-6 carboxylate (P6C), which can inactivate PLP by forming a Knoevenagel condensation product [196]. In a zebrafish model of ALDH7A1 deficiency, these reactions were found to lead to an overall reduction of available PLP in the brain and subsequently disrupt conversion of glutamate to GABA, generating spontaneous recurrent seizures [197]. Type II hyperprolinemia is characterized by the mutation of pyrroline-5’-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) [20]. P5CDH deficiency can block the conversion of pyrroline-5’-carboxylate (P5C) to glutamate, causing the accumulation of P5C in the blood. As P5C can trap PLP, similar to PLP consumption by P6C, a P5CDH mutation can deplete the available PLP in the brain, causing epilepsy.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4.5. Nutrients Potentially Beneficial for Refractory Epilepsy\\nVitamin C (also known as L-ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin that cannot be endogenously synthesized in the human body [198]. Thus, vitamin C needs to be obtained from foods such as citrus fruits (orange and grapefruit), kiwifruits, strawberries, cantaloupes, and certain vegetables (broccoli, tomatoes, brussels sprouts, and red and green peppers) [198]. Vitamin C can act as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals to protect cells from ROS-associated damages [199]. Moreover, vitamin C can serve as a co-factor in the enzymatic conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, regulating neurotransmission [200]. Several animal studies have demonstrated the anticonvulsive effects of vitamin C, which were seen via the reduction of oxidative stress regardless of model systems, including pilocarpine-, pentylenetetrazol-, penicillin-, or kainic acid-induced epilepsy [180,201,202,203,204]. However, even with supporting evidence that patients with epilepsy have shown reduced levels of serum vitamin C [205], no clinical study reporting on the efficacy of vitamin C interventions in epilepsy exists. Currently, only a phase II clinical trial to test the effects of adding vitamin C within the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy (NCT02369822) is ongoing, indicating the requirement of more efforts to elucidate the roles of vitamin C in epilepsy.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Pyruvate is a crucial intermediate in glucose metabolism. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted into acetyl coenzyme A, which enters the Krebs cycle to generate adenosine triphosphates, a cellular energy source. Pyruvate can also remove hydrogen peroxides, working as a potent antioxidant [206]. Moreover, a simple derivative of pyruvic acid, ethyl pyruvate can efficiently suppress inflammation [207], suggesting possible therapeutic benefits for epilepsy. Indeed, oral pyruvate administration could significantly reduce the number of spontaneous recurrent seizures in multiple animal models of epilepsy [208]. In addition, a combination therapy of pyruvate, vitamin C, and vitamin E could reduce the formation of seizures [180]. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that pyruvate may be a novel metabolic target able to be used to treat acquired epilepsies. Based on these preclinical results, clinical trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy of pyruvate will be necessary for the development of new nutrients beneficial for epilepsy.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n5. Conclusions\\nSince phenobarbital became known for its anticonvulsive properties in 1912, numerous antiepileptic drugs have been developed [209]. In spite of a wider array of available options in drug selection today, the incidence of refractory epilepsy remains still high, corresponding to 30% of all epilepsy patients. Dietary and nutritional supplements can help address this gap until innovative therapeutic methods are established. In this review, we have provided an overview of epilepsy and its fundamental molecular mechanisms, followed by an introduction to several functional nutrients which have the potential to manage seizure frequencies, i.e., omega-3 PUFA, vitamin D3, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and pyruvate. Despite slightly favorable efficacy having been reported in general, there is still controversy surrounding the therapeutic benefits of functional nutrients within epilepsy. We speculate that these discrepancies may come from the inclusion of various epilepsies with different etiologic backgrounds, varied durations of, and different dose regimens and treatment durations of functional nutrients. Thus, more elaborate clinical trials will be required for the accurate evaluation of nutritional supplements for epilepsy, which will enable an informative meta-analysis showing higher levels of evidence to be undertaken in future. Currently, limited dietary and nutritional consideration by patients with epilepsy can be undertaken due to insufficient research attention, which is surprising given the extensive investigative efforts devoted to other diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease and stroke [210,211,212,213]. As experimental evidence regarding putative candidate nutrients in animal models of epilepsy [214,215,216,217] is readily available, it will be necessary to examine the translational potential of these molecules to facilitate the development of nutraceuticals for epilepsy treatment. Finally, because of a study in which megavitamin therapy of pyridoxine was shown to cause neurotoxic effects [218], a cautionary note must be included regarding the optimal dose of functional nutrients.

Quantitative analysis of gene expression was performed by RT-PCR. Western blot was used to determine the expression levels of protein forkhead O1 (FOXO1). Bioinformatics analyses and luciferase reporter assay were used to verify the downstream target of miR-532-5p.\\n\\nResults\\nCompared with the non-osteoporotic controls, miR-532-5p was upregulated in osteoporotic samples, and expression of miR-532-5p was downregulated in the osteogenic C2C12 cell model. Overexpression of miR-532-5p resulted in decreased expression levels of key osteoblast markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1). The inhibitory results of miR-532-5p were reversed. MiR-532-5p contained a putative FOXO1 binding site. Moreover, miR-532-5p inhibited the expression of FOXO1, and overexpression of FOXO1 inhibited the effect of miR-532-5p on osteoblast markers.\\n\\nConclusions\\nMiR-532-5p can provide references to osteoporosis by regulating the expression of FOXO1 and osteoblast differentiation.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nBackground\\nWith the trends in population aging, the incidence of age-related diseases has increased, which requires more attention and resources to manage diseases associated with the elderly. Osteoporosis can lead to bone fragility [1]. One serious consequence of osteoporosis is the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture [2]. The pain and dysfunction caused by fracture significantly affect the quality of life of patients [3]. The prevalence rate of osteoporosis has increased significantly in recent years also due to the increased aging of the global population [4]. Therefore, it is of great social and economic value to study the pathological process of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is mainly caused by insufficient differentiation of undifferentiated stem cells in the fascia scaffold into osteoblasts after bone tissue absorption [5].\\n\\nRecent studies have found that miRNAs play critical roles in various pathological processes in the body, including cell apoptosis, biological growth, virus defense, hematopoietic processes, glycolipid metabolism, and disease development [6, 7]. They regulate the proliferation of osteoporosis and gene expression in bone tissue development, and ultimately affect the formation and metabolism of bones [8]. They are also critical regulators of signaling pathways involved in bone development and osteoblast proliferation in bone tissues [9]. MiR-532-5p is located on Xp11.23 of the human chromosome [10]. It was reported to have cancer-promoting effect in cutaneous melanoma [11]. Studies have found that it is down-regulated and can inhibit cell proliferation in a variety of solid diseases [12]. For example, the expression levels of miR-532-5p in rat osteoblasts were decreased after PTH treatment. MiR-532-5p plays a critical role in controlling bone remodeling by MMP-13 [13]. However, the role of miR-532-5p in osteoporosis is still unclear.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MiRNAs have been found to play their biological roles by regulating expression of target genes [14]. Forkhead box protein O (FOXO) is a broad-ranging transcription factor [15]. FOXO1 belongs to the FOX protein family. It regulates various pathophysiological processes such as cell differentiation, DNA damage repair, tumor metabolism, proliferation, and signal transduction [16]. Recent studies have found that the regulation of FOXO1 in bone varies with different cell types [17]. In osteoblasts, FOXO1 protein promotes protein synthesis by interacting with ATF4 to counteract oxidative stress in bone, maintaining normal proliferation of osteoblasts [18]. FOXO1 promotes the differentiation of osteoblast precursors into osteoblasts and may have an inhibitory effect on osteoclasts [18]. Studies have also found that overexpression of FOXO1 reduces the number of osteoblasts [19]. Collagen type I (COL1A1) is the main component of bone matrix and has the function of resisting deformation [20]. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is mainly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts during intrachondral osteogenesis [21]. Osteocalcin (OC) is the most abundant collagen in bone. The content of osteocalcin can effectively reflect the activity of osteoblasts [22].

In recent years, OP has become a worldwide problem that seriously jeopardizes public health, and its incidence has been ranked the first among middle-aged and elderly orthopedic diseases [26]. The main pathological characteristic of osteoporosis is inadequate bone formation during bone reconstruction [27]. The osteoblastic bone formation is an important core cell for maintaining normal bone metabolism. Therefore, osteoblasts are of great significance in patients with osteoporosis or other pathological osteoporosis.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Studies have shown that miRNAs participate in various important biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and development [28]. It has been confirmed that many miRNAs play critical roles in bone metabolism [29]. The discovery of specific microRNAs and the underlying mechanisms of their regulation in bone metabolism involves important clinical issues, such as fracture treatment, disease of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis [30]. Recent studies found that miRNAs are also involved in the differentiation and development of osteoblasts [31]. For example, the expression of miR-346 was upregulated in the hBMSCs into osteoblasts, and it could bind to glycogen synthetic kinase 313 (GSK313) to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which promoted the differentiation of osteoblasts [32]. It was reported that the expression level of miR-532-5p in osteoblasts was significantly reduced after 4\\u2009h [13]. Our study found that miR-532-5p was downregulated in OP patients was reduced. These indicated that miR-532-5p was involved in the progression of osteoporosis.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='During the differentiation of osteoblast, various osteoblast-specific genes, such as COL1A1, ALP and OC, are expressed at different stages [33]. COL1A1 is secreted by osteoblasts and is the main organic component of bone matrix. It plays a part in biomechanical properties of bone structure. The expression of COL1A1 can be considered as a molecular marker for bone formation and bone remodeling [34]. ALP is a calcium-binding transporter mainly distributed in cell membrane, and its expression gradually increases with the degree of cell differentiation, which is an early indicator of osteoblast differentiation [35]. OC is a non-collagen protein that is specifically synthesized and secreted by osteoblasts. It is an essential factor for bone calcification [36]. This study found that in BMP2-treated C2C12 cells, the expression of miR-532-5p was downregulated. The expression levels of OC, ALP and COL1A1 and the ALP activity in the miR-532-5p mimic group were decreased compared with the control group, and the results in the miR-532-5p inhibitor group were opposite. These results demonstrated that miR-532-5p can inhibit osteogenic differentiation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Studies have found that miRNAs affect the occurrence and development of diseases through regulation of different signaling pathways. FOXO1 plays important roles in many biological processes such as apoptosis, stress, DNA damage/repair, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and glucose metabolism, and bone metabolism [37]. In the osteoblast cell line, FOXO1 regulates redox balance, protein synthesis, and osteogenic differentiation of cells through interactions with transcriptional activator 4 (ATF4), bone-specific transcription factor (Runx2) and ALP [38]. The FOXO1 in osteogenic differentiation has become a research hotspot. Recent studies found that protein accumulation of FOXO1 was decreased in BMMSCs of ovariectomized mice, which was caused by accumulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) after estrogen deficiency. Mechanistically, TNF-α activated NF-κB pathway to promote the expression of microRNA-705, which functions as a repressor of FOXO1 through post-transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway or knockdown of miR-705 largely prevented the decreasing of FOXO1-mediated antioxidant defense caused by TNF-α and ameliorated the oxidative damage in osteoporotic BMMSCs [39]. This study found that expression of FOXO1 protein was significantly up-regulated in BMP2-treated C2C12 cells. FOXO1 may be a downstream target gene of miR-532-5p. In addition, co-transfection with FOXO1 siRNA in the miR-532-5p inhibitor group significantly reduced the expression levels of OC, ALP and COL1A1. These results demonstrated that miR-532-5p was able to suppress osteogenic differentiation by down-regulating the expression of FOXO1.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmc1. Introduction\\n\\nHypophosphatasia (HPP; OMIM# 146300, 241500, 241510) is a rare hereditary disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALPL gene (MIM*171760) that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP; UniprotKB# P05186). This inborn error-of-metabolism is characterized by defective skeletal and dental mineralization and other less well-understood complications resulting from deficient TNSALP activity and accumulation of its substrates [1]. Individuals with HPP have markedly heterogeneous clinical manifestations and are classified with one of the clinical subtypes of HPP based on the age of onset and severity. Biallelic variants in ALPL are associated with more severe phenotypes, whereas heterozygous variants in this gene are compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and milder phenotypes. Manifestations of HPP include defective bone mineralization with bone deformities, osteomalacia and osteopenia, spontaneous fractures, short stature/rickets, premature craniosynostosis, arthropathy, premature loss of deciduous teeth, enamel and dentin defects, and seizures [1].\\n\\nThe clinical suspicion of HPP is confirmed by low levels of serum alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and genetic screening of the ALPL gene [1]. Over 400 distinct ALPL variants have been described in association with HPP, the majority being missense variants (https://alplmutationdatabase.jku.at/table/, accessed on 8 December 2022). Several missense variants have been demonstrated to affect residues important for protein stability and function [2,3]. Here, we present a case of a female child diagnosed with a novel combination of ALPL compound heterozygous missense variants associated with childhood HPP, which presented significant clinical improvements following asfotase alfa enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for six years.\\n\\n2.

In addition, bone mineral density (BMD) (total body and lumbar spine (L1–L4)) was periodically obtained after the first year of ERT by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and data analysis showed BMD Z-scores within the normal lower range for both total body and lumbar spine, ranging from −3.4 (at the age of 3 years) to −2.9 (at the age of 7 years).

The variant inherited from the paternal side is a heterozygous substitution A → C at position 139-nt, leading to the substitution of asparagine for histidine 47 (p.Asn47His). The maternally inherited variant is a heterozygous substitution C → T at position 98-nt, leading to the substitution of alanine for valine at position 33 (p.Ala33Val) (Figure 2A, B). Both variants were classified as likely pathogenic (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria). The latter is also present in the proband’s sister. Pedigree analysis, therefore, indicated an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (in compound heterozygozity—p.[Ala33Val];[Asn47His]) because both parents and her sister were asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of only one ALPL variant and exhibited normal serum ALP activity. Based on the proband’s medical and dental history, pedigree evaluation, low serum ALP levels, elevated levels of pyridoxine, and identification of ALPL mutations, a diagnosis of childhood HPP was supported.\\n\\n3.3.

Sequence alignments revealed that both Ala33 and Asn47 are highly conserved residues among the orthologous TNSALP proteins sequences from 15 different vertebrate species (Figure 2C). However, the alignment from protein sequences encoded by ALPL, ALPI, and ALPP revealed that only Ala33 residue is highly conserved among these paralogous human sequences (Figure 2D). With respect to their structure and functional impact, both genetic alterations were distant from the active site and would not be expected to directly affect the catalytic properties of TNSALP (Figure 2E). The 3D modeling analysis showed that the affected Ala33Val residue is located in the N-terminal α-helix, whereas the affected Asn47His residue is located in the coil structure close to N-terminal α-helix. Both p.Ala33Val and p.Asn47His residues are in close proximity to the homodimer interface.\\n\\nIntramolecular and intermolecular contact analyses allowed additional predictions of the molecular effects of p.Asn47His and p.Ala33Val variants, showing that the replacement of Asn by His at position 47 may result in a gain of a hydrogen bond between the Asn47 and Thr48 residues (Figure 2F).

Computational modeling revealed the affected Asn47His residue is located in the coil structure close to N-terminal α-helix, whereas the affected Ala33Val residue is localized in the N-terminal α-helix, both located close to the homodimer interface, suggesting that both mutations might impair TNSALP dimer formation and stability. For six years, ERT was associated with improvements in growth, the skeleton, and the dentition.\\n\\nSevere forms of HPP are rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1/300,000 in the European population, 1/450,000 in Japan, 1/100,000 in the Toronto region of Canada, and 1/2500 in Mennonite families in Manitoba, Canada [7]. The prevalence of milder forms of HPP is difficult to estimate, and individuals are frequently misdiagnosed in the absence of biochemical and genetic information [8].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='While genotype–phenotype correlations have been established for some HPP-causing ALPL mutations [9], the majority are not well understood regarding how the amino acid location and type of mutations contribute to biochemical, musculoskeletal, and neurological effects. In addition, it remains to be elucidated whether the prognosis for ERT is differentially impacted by the nature of ALPL variant(s) in a patient. In the current study, two variants were identified in the proband, both located in exon 3 (NM000478.6; exon 2 in CCDS): p.Ala33Val and p.Asn47His. The p.Ala33Val variant (described as Ala16Val in the previous nomenclature) has been previously reported in the NCBI database of genetic variation (dbSNP # rs121918005) and observed in individuals affected with HPP [10,11,12,13,14]. The p.Asn47His variant has not been previously reported. This missense variant replaces asparagine (an aliphatic amino acid) with histidine (imidazole side chain, which is partially protonated, and a Brønsted acid and base), amino acids with distinct properties. Another variant affecting the same codon (NM_000478.6:c.140A > T, p.Asn47Ile) was recently reported in the ClinVar database (accession number: VCV001334791.1) in an individual with homozygous, lethal HPP, and also in a heterozygous individual with adult HPP [15]. This variant is currently classified as likely pathogenic in the curated ALPL gene variant database (https://alplmutationdatabase.jku.at/, accessed on 8 December 2022). Unfortunately, the proband’s maternal grandmother, who lost her teeth prematurely, was unavailable for molecular analysis. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that she also harbored the variant identified in her daughter and grandchild (p.Ala33Val), showing a mild form of HPP.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Previous studies have reported the impact of ALPL missense variants on enzyme activity, dimer stability, allosteric proprieties, uncompetitive inhibition, and substrate specificity and on catalytic activity, cell localization, and degradation of the mutant proteins, contributing to greater understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships [2]. Residual activity of ALPL variants located in the active site or vicinity, crown domain, and homo-dimer interface were demonstrated to be more negatively affected than variants in other domains [16]. The p.Ala33Val variant was previously reported to have a very low residual enzyme activity compared with the wild-type protein [15,16]. Although bioinformatic approaches predicted both variants to be likely pathogenic and further computational analysis suggested the location of the affected residues could impact TNSALP dimer stability, additional functional studies should be performed in order to confirm these predictions. Biallelic, compound heterozygous ALPL variants are increasingly reported for HPP, including for the Ala33 position involved in this case. Different HPP subtypes are associated with the p.Ala33Val variant: p.[Ala33Val];[Tyr236Cys] and p.[Ala33Val];[Ala33Val] genotypes were associated with perinatal HPP [10,11], whereas p.[Ala16Val];[Tyr436His], p.[Ala16Val];[Pro275Thr], and p.[Ala33Val];[Glu191Lys] were associated with infantile and severe childhood HPP, respectively [12,13,14].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The proband was treated with asfotase alfa (Strensiq™; Alexion Pharmaceuticals) ERT starting at two years old. Asfotase alfa is a hydroxyapatite-targeted recombinant form of TNSALP indicated for use in life-threatening perinatal/infantile and severe childhood or juvenile-onset cases of HPP in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan [17]. Patients treated with asfotase alfa exhibited dramatic improvements in survival, bone mineralization, growth, respiratory function, and mobility [17,18]. After six years of ERT, the proband exhibited improvements in growth, motor skills, and radiological appearance. Although clinical improvements were observed after ERT, BMD analysis failed to show substantial changes overtime. Caution should be used to interpret these findings, as a recent study has suggested that DXA BMD Z-scores presented limited value to detect deficient bone mineralization in patients with HPP [19]. Very few studies have described effects of ERT on the dentition. Schroth et al. reported that early vs. late administration of ERT to children with infantile HPP resulted in reduced rates of premature tooth exfoliation [20]. Although ERT began at two years, the proband prematurely lost deciduous incisors, canines, and molars. However, at age eight, she presented with a normal and clinically stable permanent dentition, with the exception of mild enamel defects. Indirectly, these findings suggest ERT may have contributed to the stabilization of her remaining deciduous and permanent dentitions.\\n\\n5. Conclusions\\n\\nIn conclusion, the novel combination of compound heterozygous recessive variants identified in this proband was associated with skeletal and dental manifestations of HPP, including decreased motor skills, short stature, craniosynostosis, low bone density, and premature deciduous tooth loss.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nIntroduction: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare metabolic bone disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is essential for the normal mineralisation of bone and its reduced function in this disease results in bone pain, fractures, early dental loss and calcium pyrophosphate crystal disease (CPPD) due to accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate. Disease presentation is heterogeneous, from a perinatal lethal form to milder presentations in adulthood, disease severity correlates inversely with age of symptom onset. HPP is thought to be underdiagnosed in adults in whom there is an estimated prevalence of 1/6370 in Europe. We present a case of a young woman presenting with inflammatory arthritis and a personal history of psoriasis. The diagnosis of HPP was delayed but resulted in the early diagnosis of three of her affected offspring. Afotase alfa is a recombinant ALP and has been recently licenced treatment for adults with childhood onset HPP. This case highlights the importance of careful interpretation of investigations and family history in a patient with seronegative arthritis.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n\\nCase description: A 27 year old Caucasian woman of Irish descent presented to the rheumatology clinic with a three month history of joint pain and swelling. She had awoken one day with a sudden onset of bilateral painful swollen knees. Three months later she developed pain and swelling of the ankles, wrists, elbows, metacarpalphalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal joints. She was known to have psoriasis. There was no history of fractures. Her family history was significant for her father having psoriasis and arthritis. She did not take regular medication. Examination revealed puffy, short stubby digits of the hands and nail pitting. There was no clinical evidence of synovitis but she was tender over the wrists, knees and MCP joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes were within normal ranges. Rheumatoid factor, ACPA and ANA were negative. ESR 25, CRP <1. Bilirubin 7, ALT 10, ALP 23, albumin 45, phosphate 1.35, adjusted calcium 2.37. IgG 18.8, IgA 2.60, IgM 2.2. X-rays of the pelvis, hands and feet showed no evidence of erosions, sacroilitis or chondrocalcinosis. A clinical diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) was made and she was commenced on sulfasalazine. She continued to suffer intermittent flares with associated joint swelling that affected the wrists, knees and ankles. She also complained of pain radiating from the knees into the feet. Hydroxychloroquine was added without significant benefit. She was not trialled on any further disease modifying therapies due to several pregnancies. After five years of follow up, the patient then reported difficulty climbing stairs and severe bilateral thigh pain which at times left her unable to walk. A persistently low alkaline phosphatase of below 20 was noted (normal range 30-130\\u2009U/L) and a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia was therefore considered. Further questioning revealed that the patient had a delayed walking age of two. Her eldest daughter had 12 teeth extracted at the age of eight due to poor dental health. There was also a family history of premature tooth loss in the maternal side of the family. Further investigations were undertaken. A bone scintigram demonstrated increased uptake in both knees and ankles on delayed imaging. There was no abnormal tracer uptake at the hands or feet. Urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA) was normal at 9.1 (normal range 4-17.0) μmol/L and serum vitamin B6 was raised at 196 (normal range 35-110) nmol/L. A dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) demonstrated normal bone density. Genetic testing confirmed heterogyzoneity for 1 of 280 identified mutations in the TNSALP gene. Further testing of the patient’s offspring confirmed the mutation in three of her five children, representing an autosomal dominant form. It was also later discovered that the patient’s mother had also previously been referred to the rheumatology department with early onset CPPD arthritis at age 20 which responded to colchicine. Our patient was then treated with low dose colchicine 500\\u2009mcg bd without significant improvement. Etoricoxib 60\\u2009mg was added to hydroxychloroquine 200\\u2009mg with only a mild improvement in pain. Six months ago the patient developed synovitis of five MCP joints. She responded well to an intramuscular injection of depomedrone 120\\u2009mg and methotrexate 15\\u2009mg once weekly was initiated. It was not possible to increase the dose due to nausea and the drug was discontinued after six months due to inefficacy. Leflunomide has recently been commenced.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"\\n\\n\\nDiscussion: In a young person presenting with inflammatory arthritis and a personal and family history of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a probable and common diagnosis. There were however, several features in this case which alluded to another diagnosis. The low serum ALP, late walking age, proximal myalgia, poor dentition and family history of premature tooth loss were all indicators of a diagnosis of HPP. The history early onset CPPD in the patient's mother should have ideally triggered a search for metabolic disorders, including hereditary diseases such as HPP. The patient reported episodes of sudden onset of joint pain and swelling, particularly affecting the knees which was suggestive of a crystal arthritis. These features were not typical of psoriatic arthritis, therefore the diagnosis was re-evaluated. Treatment of HPP involves avoidance of bisphosphonates, calcium and high dose vitamin D supplementation. Patients are advised against contact sports due to increased fracture risk and should receive regular specialist dental follow up. Pseudogout is usually treated by conventional means. Asfotase alfa is human recombinant ALP and was licenced in 2015 for the treatment of hypophosphatasia in adults with childhood onset of severe disease. Unfortunately this patient does not qualify for this treatment despite symptoms which significantly affect her quality of life. Given her personal and family history of psoriasis, it is possible that this patient may have coexisting HPP, CPPD and psoriatic arthritis. It was for this reason that an isotope bone scan was requested to determine the extent and pattern of joint involvement. The symmetrical oligoarticular involvement of large joints suggested that CPPD was the more likely diagnosis at that time. She patient was started on methotrexate due to later evidence of active inflammation of small joints and because this would also be the treatment of choice for PsA. There is evidence that both hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate are of benefit in treating chronic CPPD arthritis. Anti-IL-1 drugs such as Anakinra have been used in small case series for CPPD with some benefit. Aspiration and microscopic evaluation of synovial fluid would have been of great use in confirming CPPD arthritis but still does not exclude dual pathology. This patient has not ever had evidence of a joint effusion on clinical review and therefore synovial fluid analysis has not been possible. A diagnosis of CPPD can be challenging if synovial crystals and chondrocalcinosis on x-ray are absent as in this case. There is emerging evidence of a role for ultrasound and Dual Energy CT scanning in the diagnosis of crystal arthritis, including CPPD. Establishing the correct diagnosis in this patient was particularly valuable as it has allowed genetic screening and early diagnosis and treatment of other family members.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Key Learning Points: In a patient with a seronegative non-erosive arthritis, not responding to treatment, the diagnosis should be regularly reviewed. Hypophosphatasia is a rare inherited metabolic bone disease, the milder forms of which can present in adulthood. HPP can present to rheumatology clinic with early onset CPPD arthritis, metatarsal and atypical fractures and/or proximal myopathy. A persistently low serum ALP should prompt detailed evaluation of the dental, musculoskeletal and family history for features of HPP. CPPD arthritis can be challenging to diagnose in the absence of a synovial effusion. There is now effective treatment licensed for adults with childhood onset of severe HPP.\\n\\n\\nDisclosure: M.S.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is one of the main biomarkers that is clinically detected in bone and liver disorders using optical assays. The electrochemical principle is important because point-of-care testing is increasing dramatically and absorbance techniques hardly compete with the medical revolution that is occurring. The detection of ALP using electrochemical detection is contributing to the integration systems field, and hence enhancing the detection of biological targets for pharmaceutical research and design systems. Moreover, in vitro electrochemical measurements use cost effective materials and simple techniques. Graphite screen-printed electrodes and linear sweep voltammetry were used to optimize the electrochemistry of the enzymatic product p-aminophenol using the enzyme kinetic assay. ALP release from embryonic and cancer cells was determined from adhesion cell culture. Additionally, capillary electrophoresis and colorimetric methods were applied for comparison assays. The resulting assays showed a dynamic range of ALP ranging from 1.5 to 1500 U/L, and limit of detection of 0.043 U/L. This was achieved by using 70 μL of the sample and an incubation time of 10 min at an optimal substrate concentration of 9.6 mM of p-aminophenol phosphate. A significant difference (p < 0.05) was measured between the absorbance assays. This paper demonstrates the advantages of the electrochemical assay for ALP release from cells, which is in line with recent trends in gene expression systems using microelectrode array technologies and devices for monitoring electrophysiological activity.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\n1. Introduction\\nALP is a homodimeric enzyme. It has cofactors that include two zinc atoms and one magnesium atom in each subunit, which are important for the active sites [1]. ALP is found in almost all living tissue and can be expressed in four isoforms. Abnormal levels of ALP release can be seen in illnesses (such as liver disease, bone disorders, etc.), or during pregnancy or the rapid growth phases of childhood [2,3]. Recently, ALP has been identified as a potential cancer biomarker, and its early detection could potentially help in the treatment of the disease [4].\\n\\nElectrochemistry allows integration in small devices, which is required for point-of-care testing. Electrochemical detection techniques are relatively easy to use and offer relatively fast detection. This is reflected in Clark’s work (1954) [5]. Electrochemical biosensors for ALP have rapidly developed since 1991, when Thomson and his team published their work comparing ALP resolution using an electrochemical assay to results from optical detection [6]. The principle was based on hydrolyzing o-phosphate by ALP in the presence of the p-aminophenyl phosphate (pAPP), where the non-electroactive substrate under the alkaline environment served to generate an electroactive substrate (pAP). This research has contributed to the development of ALP electrochemical detection [7,8,9,10,11].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Investigation of ALP release as a quantitative indicator of gene reporting in mammalian cells began in 1988 [12]. However, it was not until the development of the electrochemical immunoassay [13] that the electrochemistry of ALP release as a secretion enzyme from cells began to grow in popularity [14,15,16]. Almost ten years later, a proper protocol of ALP release was investigated using methods of molecular biology, biochemistry, enzymology, and chemiluminescence. These findings enhanced the detection of ALP using electrochemistry [17,18,19,20]. Kelso et al., 2000 exploited the electrochemical immunoassay, and were likely the first to detect secreted ALP in media using screen-printed electrodes and 2-naphthyl phosphate [21]. The initial protocols of ALP release in vitro used the same strategies used for β-galactosidase [22,23,24,25,26]. This was carried out by way of electrochemical analysis and using different samples, including single-cell analysis [27,28,29], biopsies [30], tissues [31] and accumulation of cells [32,33]. These strategies have their own disadvantages. For example, using a reducing agent (e.g., β-mercaptoethanol) caused inactivation of intracellular ALP [34,35,36]. Moreover, issues relating to electrochemical analysis, including buffer components, volusme of the electrolyte, and the parameters required during the assay, were not optimised [37,38,39]. This caused less concentration of ALP release.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='So far, investigations of ALP release from MCF-7 breast cancer cells, A549 lung cancer cells, and HT-29 colon cancer cells have only been carried out using fluorescence [40]. The optimization achieved as a result of spectroscopy would be negatively affected by the limitations (e.g., the cost, and the size of instruments). Accordingly, this paper will explore the parameters of the enzyme assay and apply the electrochemical assay for ALP release from living cells. Therefore, linear sweep voltammetry was used because it has a wide potential window, as it is a droplet-based assay and requires no stirring solution. These are important factors for point-of care application. The incubation time of the sample, the kinetic enzyme assay of the substrate, and calibration plots were studied in order to carry out regression analysis using the two methods illustrated in plate A and plate B (Figure 1). Separation techniques that included capillary electrophoresis were also used. Capillary electrophoresis was used because it distinguishes isoenzymes alongside the standard methods of colorimetry [41]. Finally, the assays were compared in order to assess the sensitivity of electrochemistry analysis.'),\n",

Chemicals and Instruments\\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP, calf intestinal phosphatase) or 4-aminophenol (p-AP) was purchased from Sigma (Ireland) and used to make stock solution at a final concentration of 1500 U/L or 5 mM. The alkaline buffer assay at pH 9.5 was made by adding sterile deionized water at grade 18 MΩ provided from Tyndall National Institute (UCC), which contained diethanolamine (DEA) 1 M, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) 8 mM, sodium chloride (NaCl) 50 mM, potassium chloride (KCl) 100 mM, para-aminophenol phosphate (p-APP) and HCl purchased from Sigma (Wicklow, Ireland).

The first step was to enhance ALP release in 4-day-old culture by seeding cells as a monolayer on 48-well plates (Sigma, Ireland), incubating at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (incusafe Panasonic incubator) and changing media every two days. The cell lines used during this study were purchased from ATCC (UK), including mouse embryo fibroblast cells (Balb/c 3T3 Line), breast carcinoma epithelial cells (MCF-7 Line), lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A-549 Line), and colon carcinoma epithelial cells (Ht-29 Line). The media, supplements, and washing buffer used for culturing cells were Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), minimum essential medium Eagle (MEME) and McCoy’s 5A medium, newborn calf serum (NBCS), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), which were purchased from Sigma (Ireland).

Stabilization of Graphite Screen-Printed Electrodes\\nGraphite screen-printed electrodes (graphite-SPE) were first cleaned using iso-propanol and a plasmon cleaner device for 10 min or for 20 min and compared to non-cleaned electrodes. Potassium [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− (1 mM) was dissolved in 1.0 M of KCl. [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− solution (5 mL) was used to immerse the graphite-SPE. A Palmsens potentiostat device was used to carry out the cyclic voltammetry assay and to compare the data before and after the cleaning process. The cyclic voltammetry detection techniques were applied at scan rates from 5 mV/S to 200 mV/S and at initial potential of −0.2 V and final potential of 0.6 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The potential range of each scan rate of cyclic voltammograms was plotted against the response current.

Graphite screen-printed electrodes were first cleaned using plasma cleaner for 20 min and linear sweep voltammetry measurements were carried out at potentials ranging from −1.2 V to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The measurements were completed in triplicate at a volume of 70 μL and a scan rate of 100 mV/S. To determine a probable working range for the product pAP, serial dilutions of pAP, starting with 5 mM were prepared in the presence of 30 μL of sample mixed with 100 μM of pAPP. The linear sweep voltammetry was measured for each concentration at three separate electrodes. A free-pAP buffer was used as blank. A graph charting current response to concentration of pAP was prepared for regression analysis. The incubation time evaluation for ALP release was performed using 70 μL of a sample with 20 U/L of ALP activity mixed with 30 μL of pAPP 5 mM in buffer DEA and assessed at 5-min intervals over 60 min. NaOH (30 μL of 1 M) was added in order to stop the reaction. The reaction time was fixed to 10 min, and the activity of the sample was assessed with different concentrations of substrate range (5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.63, 0.31, 0.16, 0.08, and 0.04 mM pAPP).

The cells were incubated in the assay buffer for 10 min before measurement. Linear sweep voltammetry was applied in triplicate in three separate graphite-SPEs at a final volume of 70 μL, against a free-pAPP buffer that was used as a blank.

Concentration of the Substrate pAPP from Adhesion Cells\\nAdherent cells have different responses from non-adherent cells in terms of releasing ALP. Therefore, the concentration of substrate pAPP needed to be assessed in order to allow for real-time monitoring of ALP. The serial dilution of pAPP, starting with 5 mM, was carried out in the range of 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.60, 0.30, 0.16, 0.08 and 0.04 mM in the assay buffer. The range of diluted pAPP was incubated with cells for 10 min. The electrochemical assay was applied with a final volume of 70 μL against a free-pAPP buffer as blank.

Capillary electrophoresis or colorimetric measurements were carried out in triplicate at a volume of 70 μL at a range of the product pNP (15–500 μM) using the wavelength 405 nm. The serial dilutions of pNP were prepared in the presence of 30 μL of sample mixed with 6 mM of pNPP. A graph relating peak area of absorbance to concentration of pNP was prepared for regression analysis. The slopes and intercepts of the reaction were used for normalizing the data in molarity. The separation of samples was performed in a 50 μm inner diameter fused-silica capillary with a length of 15 cm. The data were collected and processed using the capillary electrophoresis system and Agilent ChemStation software. The running conditions included a voltage of 15 kV, a capillary temperature of 20 °C and a wavelength of 405 nm, and injection of the sample was for 5 s and 15 mbar. A calibration plot of absorbance assay of ALP activity was obtained using the same sample preparation in electrochemical measurement. ALP release was performed using 70 μL of a sample spiked with various concentrations of ALP (calf intestinal phosphatase) at a range of 1–1500 U/L dissolved in 30 μL of pNPP 6 mM in buffer DEA and incubated for 30 min. NaOH (30 μL of 1 M) was added to stop the reaction. The Michaelis-Menten model was used to fit the data. The resulting sole and intercept were determined using Vmax and km constants to normalize the data.'),\n",

Stabilization of Graphite Screen-Printed Electrodes\\nCyclic voltammetry was applied where 1 M KCl was used as the electrolyte for the standard reaction redox of ferri/ferrocyanide. Non-cleaned electrodes and cleaned electrodes for 10 min and cleaned electrodes for 20 min were compared. Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammogram background of electrodes before and after cleaning using Plasmon cleaner. It is evident that the potential window of the cleaned electrodes (Figure 2B,C) is narrow compared to that of non-cleaned electrodes (Figure 2A). In the insert in Figure 2, the linear relationship observed between the peak current and the square root of the scan rate with a high linear regression R2 of 0.98 is outlined. The anodic (ipa) and cathodic (ipc) current peaks display a sensitive performance in electrodes cleaned for 20 min compared to the other electrodes. The electrochemical performance of cleaned electrodes for 20 min in plasmon cleaner was more stable than others. The other electrodes displayed shifts in the potential as the scan rate increased. It appears that the faradic current was affected by any background current. Table 2 summarizes the influence of the scan rate on the half peak potential (Emid vs. Ag/AgCl) and peak-to-peak separation (∆Ep) of anodic and cathodic peaks. The anodic and cathodic peak ratio was 0.98–1.03 as the scan rate increased performance in electrodes cleaned for 20 min. This showed the reversible reaction of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−.'),\n",

Electrodes that had not been cleaned had a potential oxidation peak of 0.3–0.45 V as the scan rate increased. This indicates that the cleaning process can positively enhance electron transfer, and that a 20-min cleaning time is sufficient to overcome the limitations of diffusion processes. Moreover, the value of ∆Ep at 200 mV/S presented by non-cleaned electrodes was too high (300 mV), which indicates that some sort of contamination occurred on the electrode surface. Cleaning the surface electrodes was important as, after 10 min and 20 min, decrements of the value ∆Ep were observed, which were 163 mV and 58 mV, respectively. Considering the theoretical value of ∆Ep is 59 mV for single electron transfer of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−, the closest experimental value achieved was 58 mV. Therefore, treatment with oxygen plasma for 20 min was constantly used for further electrochemical investigations.'),\n",

Optimization of Electrochemical Measurement\\nFor the electrochemical detection of mammalian ALP release, the electroactive compound p-aminophenol (pAP) is produced from the enzyme reacting with a p-aminophenyl phosphate substrate.

Figure 3A shows the linear sweep voltammograms of different concentrations of pAP (0.16–5 mM). The measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 100 mV/S and at a range of potentials between −1.2 and 1.5 V. The current response of the pAP increased in potentials at points between 0 and 0.3 V. The insert curve shows the standard curve of the mass-transfer limited current of pAP. Furthermore, the values of intercept and slope of regression lines from these six concentrations were calculated as 5.931 and 11.866. The current response for the oxidation of pAP indicated a good linear relationship, where R2 was 0.996. pAP (5 mM) generated 180 μA, and the lowest concentration of 0.16 mM generated 20 μA.

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n3.5. Comparative Study of ALP Activity\\nAn electrochemical optimized assay was compared to absorbance outputs using the optical active substrate pNPP and two different methods: capillary electrophoresis and colorimetry. The former was applied due to its selective monitoring of p-nitrophenol and because it eliminates any interference with endogenous ALP in the sample. The latter is a standard method for ALP analysis. The analysis was carried out in the presence of 70 μL of the product pNP in the range of 15–500 μM and 30 μL of sample mixed with of 6 mM of pNPP. Figure 6A shows electropherograms of different concentrations of p-nitrophenol in the presence of 1 mM DEA adjusted to pH = 9.5, temperature 20 °C, voltage of 15 kV and wavelength of 405 nm. The measurements of pNP taken in a fused-silica capillary with an effective length of 15 cm and a diameter of 50 μm displayed peaks at migration time of 5 min. This also was confirmed by other studies [45,46,47]. The separation peaks were affected by the length of incubation time and by applied voltage [45]. CE is an ideal assay for further investigation of ALP isoenzymes, as it performs sensitive detection in alkaline buffer. This is an appropriate environment for ALP. The insert details the calibration plot of pNP concentrations versus the peak areas, which displayed very good linear regression of R2 = 0.99, slope of 70.13 mAU/µM and intercept of 9.68 mAU. This was used for normalizing the peaks’ areas of ALP release from living cells with values obtained by colorimetric analysis. Figure 6B shows the calibration curve of absorbance versus various concentrations of ALP ranging from 1.5–1500 U/L and fitted by the Michaelis–Menten model. The standards had 30 μL of sample dissolved with pNPP 6 mM in buffer DEA and were incubated for 30 min. Data in triplicate were plotted using origin software. The correlation coefficient was found to be 0.99, and the Vmax and km of the curve were found to be 4.25 and 67.81 U/L. The correlation slope (km/Vmax) and intercept (1/Vmax) were calculated from the constants and were used for comparing data with the electrochemical assay. The insert outlines the linearity studies of colorimetric assay carried out in the presence of different concentrations of pNP (14–500 µM). The regression analysis was 0.99, and the slope and intercept of the curves were found to be 5.53 and 0.34. These were used for normalizing data and comparing them with the capillary electrophoresis assay. Figure 6C shows the normalizing data of ALP release from cells represented by formation of the product pNP. Capillary electrophoresis and colorimetric assay displayed good correlation. No significant difference (p > 0.05) resulted from the two methods. It is obvious that the lowest ALP level was determined by Balb/c 3T3 cells, which was 0.16–0.17 mM, whereas the highest level of ALP was of colon cancer cells and was in the range of 0.48–0.50 mM. Lung and breast cancer cells had almost the same levels of ALP (0.21–0.22 mM and 0.20–0.21 mM, respectively). Moreover, the ALP of lung cancer was slightly higher than breast cancer, and results showed very small standard deviation. Figure 6D outlines details of the comparative analysis performed on the absorbance and optimized electrochemical assay of ALP release from living cells. The electrochemical or optical data of ALP release from cells were normalized using the Lineweaver–Burke equation shown in Figure 3C and the Michaelis-Menten model shown in Figure 6B. There was a significant difference (p > 0.05) in the activity of ALP release from cells between electrochemical and optical assays. The electrochemical results of ALP activity from Balb/c 3T3, A549, MCF-7 and Ht-29 were higher than ALP activity obtained by absorbance analysis. This optimization demonstrated that evaluation of ALP release by electrochemical assay was more sensitive than by optical assay. Moreover, it showed faster detection as the optical active substrate needed 30 min for evaluating ALP release in samples, while that of the electro active substrate only needed 10 min.'),\n",

Conclusions\\nAlkaline phosphatase is a cancer biomarker, and the monitoring of ALP release from cells contributes to an understanding of the basis of diseases and the progression of cancer. The aim of this paper was to develop a methodology for monitoring ALP release from two types of cells: embryo fibroblast cells (Balb/c 3T3) and cancer epithelial cells (A549, MCF-7, Ht-29), using electrochemical analysis. At alkaline pH, the enzyme ALP hydrolyzes the non-electroactive p-aminophenol phosphate to generate the electroactive, p-aminophenol. The electrochemical behaviour of the sensors used was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and using the solution [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− as the model for single transfer electrons. A cleaning duration of 20 min for the sensors in the Plasmon cleaner gives good electrochemical behaviour. The anodic and cathodic peak ratio was almost 1 (ia/ic = 1), and the half peak potential (Emid vs. Ag/AgCl) showed a reversibility reaction. The peak-to-peak separation (∆Ep) of anodic and cathodic peaks was 62 mV. Linear sweep voltammetry detection techniques that have a wide window of potential were applied using graphite-SPE at a scan rate of 100 mV/S and at a potential ranging from −1.2 V to 1.5 V vs. a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl. This demonstrated the standard curve of pAP, and allowed for observation of the potential where oxidation peaks occur. This was at 0–0.15 V of the current response (0–150 µA) displayed when the concentration of pAP (0.16–5 mM) was increasing. The oxidation peaks of pAP began at −100 mV and ended at 300 mV as the concentration increased. The samples were incubated with substrate for different amounts of time. They displayed a positive linear dependence and 10 min was selected as the time to do the rest of the experiments. The substrate pAPP was optimized using detached cells and had a Michaelis constant (km) of 0.548 mM, (Imax) of 136.59 and an optimal p-APP concentration of 9.69 mM. A calibration plot was obtained based on the optimization measurements from a range of 1–1500 U/L. ALP release was determined from various cell numbers for linearity analysis. All cells exhibited linear trends with good regression analysis. The pAPP substrate was investigated during cellular adhesion, and km and Imax were calculated for each cell line. Capillary electrophoresis and colorimetric methods were applied for comparative analysis. CE allows for the detection of ALP release with substrates at the same time, which can be used for distinguishing ALP iso-enzymes. The samples were introduced onto the capillary automatically. The average detection time for p-nitrophenol was 5 min. Colorimetry, which is the standard assay of ALP in clinical analysis, showed compatible values with CE. A calibration curve of ALP was created to allow for comparison of the data obtained by optical and electrochemical analysis. This revealed a significant difference between the two, indicating that the electrochemical investigation resulted in a more sensitive and rapid assay than the optical analysis.'),\n",

Additionally, alternative splicing events were observed in controls, such as c.6842_6937del (exon 12 skipping) and c.476_631del (exon 6 and 7 skipping). Because these in-frame transcripts are also expressed in healthy controls and have an unknown function, their clinical relevance remains unclear. This has consequences for the classification of c.6935A>T, which leads to increased expression of c.6842_6937del compared with controls.

In POP3, less than 40× coverage was obtained only for 6 amplicons. All sequence reads for the 22 patients of POP1 and POP2 were analyzed with our in-house variant identification pipeline (Deschrijver et al., submitted) using the empirically determined filters (minimum coverage: 40×; maximum homopolymer length: 7; minimum variant frequency: 33%).

The condition is characterized by severe photosensitivity, abnormal pigmentation, and an increase, by a factor of 1000 or more, in the risk of cancers in sun-exposed tissues (skin and eye) in affected individuals. The disorder is caused by mutations in a number of genes, all (XPA–XPG) but one (XP-variant) involved in the nucleotide excision repair (ner) pathway. The heterozygote (clinically normal-appearing carrier) frequency of XP gene mutations is estimated at about 1 in 300. Cancer risk of heterozygotes is not known. We report on the frequency of hereditary breast cancer among xp families.\\n\\nMethods\\nThe study population consists of 22 xp families with detailed multi-generation pedigrees and epidemiology information ascertained under a protocol to study the natural history of the disorder.

In BRCA1 and BRCA2 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, several mutations are part of a fc panel which is used as a first line of testing.\\n\\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the detection rate of the fc panel currently used in the chum diagnostic laboratory.

Included in our analysis were index cases for whom the affected branch of the family was of fc descent, for whom a whole blood sample could be obtained, and who had both panel testing and sequencing if panel testing was negative (n = 301).\\n\\nResults\\nFrom January 2005 to December 2008, 408 cases of fc descent were screened for 9 mutations (R1443X, 2953del3+C, 3768insA, W321X for BRCA1; 8765delAG, E1953X, 3398del5, 2816insA, 6503delTT for BRCA2). Of the 301 index cases corresponding to our inclusion criteria, 69 were identified as mutation carriers. Of these 69 carriers, 57 were found to carry a mutation from the fc panel (82.6%). The remaining 12 had a mutation identified by sequencing (17.4%), and 5 of these mutations (2080insA, 2244insA, 2800delAA for BRCA1; 3773delTT, r2336H for BRCA2) were reported in at least 2 distinct families. By adding these mutations to our in-house panel, our detection rate will reach 97.1% (67/69).\\n\\nConclusions\\nThis retrospective review of our laboratory data indicates that the detection rate of our in-house fc panel of 9 mutations is 82.6%. By adding 5 mutations, this detection rate will reach 97.1%. These preliminary data indicate that testing using the fc panel in appropriate families continues to be a cost-effective initial screening. The data are insufficient to preclude further testing by sequencing in panel-negative families. A periodic review of mutations identified by sequencing in fc families is important to improve and validate the efficiency of the fc panel.'),\n",

PALB2 is estimated to confer a moderately increased risk for breast cancer, likely because of a disruption of genomic regulation. To date, the underlying pathogenesis of PALB2 mutations has yet to be illuminated by common molecular mechanisms. It has previously been suggested that Fanconi anemia proteins, a group of which PALB2 is a member, may play a critical role in the telomere maintenance pathway, because of their core function in genetic recombination. In the current study, we attempt to establish both a molecular and cellular link between PALB2 heterozygous mutations and genomic instability, an important precursor to carcinogenesis.'),\n",

Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Ten years ago, testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Manitoba was limited to the three common mutations found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and shortly thereafter included screening by protein truncation testing. Through results obtained in-house and from published data, it became recognized that one of the three common mutations, BRCA1 c.5266dupC (5382insC), was also common in individuals of European descent, particularly those from Eastern Europe. Twelve unrelated Manitoban families were identified with the c.5266dupC mutation over the first 8 years of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing in Manitoba, and of these, only 4 (30%) are from families of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The remaining cases were found in families reported to be of Ukrainian (n = 5), Polish (n = 1), Hungarian (n = 1), and German/unknown (n = 1) descent, with no known Jewish background. Given this observation and the relatively high proportion of the Manitoba population being of Eastern European descent, an ethnic-specific panel targeted to individuals of Eastern European descent was created. It included three BRCA1 mutations (c.5266dupC, p.Cys61Gly, c.4034delA) that were described in literature as “recurrent” for this population. Over the past 3 years, 55 Manitobans have been tested, and two new families with mutations in BRCA1 were found, one with c.5266dupC and one with p.Cys61Gly. The c.5266dupC case, representing our 13th family, was identified in a woman of Ukrainian/German Mennonite descent who had bilateral breast cancer. The p.Cys61Gly was found in a Ukrainian family with a history of breast and ovarian cancer. A second unrelated family of Ukrainian descent was identified with the p.Cys61Gly mutation through denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography mutation scanning of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. As part of our full screen available to affected patients who meet our testing criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2, a novel and yet recurrent BRCA1 genomic deletion involving exons 13 through 19 was identified in 3 unrelated Manitoban families, with Ukrainian descent being the only common theme. Data accumulated thus far suggest that the founder BRCA1 mutations for Manitobans of Eastern European descent are similar to those described by others, c.5266dupC and p.Cys61Gly, and that this unique in-frame deletion involves exons 13–19.'),\n",

Over the last few centuries, persecution forced this group to migrate throughout Northern and Eastern Europe, and then to Southern Manitoba (Canada), the American Midwest, Mexico, and Central and South America. There are about 66,000 Mennonites residing in the Canadian province of Manitoba, accounting for approximately 6% of its total population. Founder mutations have been identified in the Mennonite population for a number of genetic diseases, including hypophosphatasia, X-linked congenital stationary night blindness, and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We have identified a mutation, c.5238dupT (p.Asn1747fs), in the BRCA2 gene in 4 unrelated Mennonite families. The index patients were referred for genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes because of personal and family histories of breast and ovarian cancer. One family also had a history of pancreatic cancer. Of the 4 families, 3 were long-time residents of Manitoba; 1 family had recently emigrated from Bolivia. Further investigations into the pedigrees did not reveal any common relatives between the families. These mutations were independently identified by dna sequencing following the observation of a truncated band using the protein truncation test targeted to exon 11 of BRCA2. The c.5238dupT mutation has been reported only a limited number of times in the Breast Cancer Information Core database and in the literature, and it has been restricted to patients of Dutch, German, Mennonite, and Western and Eastern European descent. The finding of 4 large pedigrees of Mennonite descent indicates the presence of a founder mutation in the Manitoba Mennonite population. The population frequency of this BRCA2 c.5238dupT mutation among Manitoba Mennonites is not known, but it may be of value to offer targeted mutation analysis to individuals of Mennonite descent who have a personal and/or family history of breast and ovarian cancer. However, it is important to note that other mutations, such as BRCA2 c.6952C>T (p.Arg2318X), have been identified in Manitoba Mennonites with strong family histories of cancer. Such families that meet testing criteria and do not carry the c.5238dupT mutation should be offered full screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2.'),\n",

The polymorphisms genotyped were: +331G/A and progins, localized in the progesterone receptor gene, CASP8 D302H, CASP8–652 6Nins/del, FGFR2 (rs2981582), and TNRC9 (rs3803662). Familial clustering was taken into account in the statistical analyses.\\n\\nResults\\nTwo polymorphisms modified the risk of oc in BRCA1 and BRCA2 families: +331 G/A heterozygous genotype increased the risk [odds ratio (or): 2.41; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.98 to 5.96; p = 0.056], and FGFR2 had a protective effect (or: 0.52; 95% ci: 0.28 to 0.96; p = 0.037).

Thus, it seems likely that there are additional high-penetrance loci to be discovered. In 2006, we published the results of a linkage analysis in 149 multiple-case bc pedigrees. Although several regions of interest were identified, no definitive evidence of linkage was found, likely because of genetic heterogeneity. To address this, we have now analyzed a further set of 123 families that were part of an international consortium in familial bc including families from North America (n = 53), Europe (n = 57), and Australia (n = 14). All families had at least 3 cases of bc diagnosed at or before the age of 60 and were previously screened for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Among the known regulators, MDM4, a haploinsufficient homologue of MDM2, has been shown to bind and inhibit tp53 protein. As part of a candidate tp53 pathway approach, a statistically significant association with breast cancer (bc) risk was observed at the MDM4 locus in our recent genome-wide association study (gwas) in the Ashkenazi Jewish (aj) population. We observed a large extent of linkage disequilibrium around the MDM4 locus in aj bc cases from our aj gwas, with multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) significantly associated with bc risk. Analysis of these data revealed a susceptible haplotype and a modestly elevated bc risk [p = 0.01; odds ratio (or): 1.2; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.01 to 1.45]. To replicate these findings, we genotyped a tagging snp for this haplotype (rs2369244) in independent collections of 654 aj bc cases and 1085 aj controls. Similar to the findings in the gwas cohorts, the minor allele homozygotes were significantly enriched in cases as compared with controls (p = 0.01; or: 1.19; 95% ci: 1.04 to 1.38). Furthermore, a pooled meta-analysis including the gwas data (total of 1133 bc cases and 1351 controls), and controlling for age, suggests that this snp significantly associates with bc risk in aj population. The association was most apparent for minor allele homozygotes (G/G—or: 1.52; 95% ci: 1.18 to 1.95; p = 0.00085). Further replication analysis is being planned as part of an international Breast Cancer Association Consortium involving more than 60,000 bc cases and controls of predominantly European ancestry. Besides ongoing functional experiments, the next phase of the study will address possible gene–gene interactions of MDM4 rs2369244 with other critical players in this pathway, including MDM2 snp309 and TP53 R72P, where genetic variation has also been described to be associated with increased risks for other cancer types.'),\n",

However, the spectrum and frequency distribution of ATM mutations that confer increased risk of breast cancer have been controversial. To assess the contribution of rare variants in this gene to risk of breast cancer, we pooled data from seven published ATM case–control mutation screening studies including a total of 1544 breast cancer cases and 1224 controls with data from our own mutation screening of an additional 987 breast cancer cases and 1021 controls. Using an in silico missense substitution analysis that provides a ranking of missense substitutions from evolutionarily most likely to least likely, we carried out analyses of protein-truncating variants, splice junction variants, and rare missense variants. We found marginal evidence that the combination of ATM protein-truncating and splice junction variants contribute to breast cancer risk. There was stronger evidence that a subset of rare, evolutionarily unlikely missense substitutions confer increased risk. On the basis of subset analyses, we hypothesize that rare missense substitutions falling in and around the fat, kinase, and fatc domains of the protein may be disproportionately responsible for that risk, and that a subset of these may confer higher risk than do protein-truncating variants. We conclude that a comparison between the graded distributions of missense substitutions in cases versus controls can complement analyses of truncating variants to help identify susceptibility genes, and that this approach will help interpret the data emerging from new sequencing technologies.'),\n",

Currently, there is no effective treatment for ulms. Infrequent occurrences of human ulms hamper the understanding of the initiation and progression of the disease, thereby limiting the ability to develop efficient therapies. To elucidate the roles of the p53 and BRCA1 tumour suppressor genes in gynecologic malignancies, we generated mice in which p53 and/or BRCA1 can be conditionally deleted using anti-Müllerian hormone type ii receptor (Amhr2)–driven Cre recombinase. Mice with a conditional deletion of p53 developed uterine tumours that resembled human ulms. A concurrent deletion of p53 and BRCA1 accelerated the progression of those tumours. Consistent with the hypothesis that BRCA1 plays a role in ulms, we have shown that the BRCA1 protein is absent in 29% of human ulms. We have demonstrated that BRCA1 promoter methylation is the likely mechanism of BRCA1 downregulation in human ulms. Our findings provide a rationale for investigating therapies that target BRCA1 deficiency in ulms.'),\n",

Our hypothesis is that BRCA1/2 carriers will more often present with a palpable mass than be identified through imaging and that they will be diagnosed with advanced-stage disease that requires traditional chemotherapy. We also wanted to examine the relationship between mutation status and pathology. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of female breast cancer patients who carried BRCA1/2 mutations to determine how women find their cancers and how those cancers are treated. Our study included 66 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and who carried a BRCA1/2 mutation. Almost half the women presented with palpable masses, but only 1/2 were diagnosed by mammographic findings. Surprisingly, of the 66 cancers, 50 were diagnosed at stage 0–iib, and only 5 were diagnosed at stage iii or higher. BRCA1 cancers were more often triple-negative than were BRCA2 cancers (42% and 21% respectively). Although these cancers were diagnosed at early stages, 92% of BRCA1 carriers and 68% of BRCA2 carriers still were treated with traditional chemotherapy. We feel that, if a woman is presented with this data showing that an impending cancer will more often than not require chemotherapy, she may choose more aggressive management and opt for prophylactic mastectomy.

McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada9 2009 100 100 Introduction\\nBreast reconstruction is an important procedure that requires attention to detail for optimal outcome. Spectrum implants (Mentor Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA, U.S.A.) have provided us with the tools to optimally adjust for achieving symmetry and patient satisfaction. Single-staged breast reconstruction with saline implants was first introduced by Becker in 1982. Despite advances in our surgical techniques and prosthesis, the reported complication rate remains high at 28%.\\n\\nPurpose\\nWe present the senior author’s experience over a period of 7 years for immediate and delayed breast reconstruction as it relates to implant reconstruction. This is the first reported study of breast reconstruction using Spectrum Expander/Implant with the use of the same retropectoral technique and no alloderm. All implants were saline-filled.\\n\\nMethods\\nA retrospective review analysis of patients undergoing Spectrum implants by the senior author from 2001 to 2008 is presented. Specific attention is paid to factors associated with major complications.'),\n",

Prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction is an option discussed with all women, and high-risk breast screening is offered as the alternative. Screening includes clinical breast exam and imaging every 6 months, with an alternating schedule of breast mri (from age 25) and mammography (from age 30). Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (pbso) is recommended to all mutation carriers. Ovarian cancer screening is not currently recommended.

Lynch H. Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.A9 2009 101 101 The effect of a reminder telephone call intervention designed to encourage mammography has not been systematically studied in a high-risk population in which compliance is crucial. We hypothesize that a simple reminder telephone call would significantly increase mammography uptake in high-risk women as compared with a control group. In 447 high-risk women, consent to participate in the study was obtained. Interestingly, 346 (77%) of these women self-reported being compliant in obtaining annual mammography for the preceding 2 years. Verification was established in a subset of these women by obtaining their mammogram reports. Subjects who were noncompliant by self-report (n = 32) were randomized to the intervention or the control group. Reminder and follow-up telephone calls were completed on 16 women in the experimental group, and follow-up calls were completed on 15 women in the control group. One woman was excluded from the study after being diagnosed with breast cancer upon obtaining a mammogram. A statistical difference (p = 0.0017) was observed between the two groups in support of the hypothesis that mammography compliance in high-risk women can be increased if an intervention such as a simple reminder call is implemented. Future studies should identify barriers in obtaining mammograms in these high-risk individuals.'),\n",

Indeed, a service offered by the personal genetics company, 23andMe, was named invention of the year for 2008 (Hamilton, 2008). And in the same year, the investigation of genetic variation was deemed the scientific breakthrough of the year by Science magazine. The entire field also gets a tremendous amount of media attention, garnering almost daily coverage in the popular press.\\n\\nOne of the foundational rationales for this emerging field—and the reason for much of the excitement–is that it will allow for a more holistic and preventive approach to the management of chronic diseases, including many forms of cancer (Scheuner et al., 2008). This rationale can be found in both the academic literature and in the marketing strategies of companies offering direct-to-consumer genetic tests.

This is called “secondary use.” The secondary use of data and samples is current practice among health care researchers, even more so since the increasing use of biobanks. However, particular issues arise when the participant to whom the samples and data are linked is deceased. Although ethical and legal framing of secondary use of samples and data of live participants is in place and is consistent across various normative texts, the framework concerning deceased participants is often less developed and sometimes inexistent.

Earlier studies were limited by screening for the mutations that recur in this founder population. We have assessed the contribution of BRCA1/2 to 75 hbc and 51 hboc fc families who have at least 3 cancer cases per family and who have undergone Myriad Genetics mutation screening and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis for rearrangements. About 50% of the hbc families were mutation-negative. About 32% were 3-case families, in which 71% were mutation-negative (p = 0.014). The distribution of cases relative to an index tested case in the hbc mutation-negative group differed from that in the mutation-positive group (p = 0.004), where more first-degree relatives with breast cancer were observed in the mutation-negative families (56%) than in the mutation-positive families (35%, p = 0.0009). The frequency of breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 36 years in the hbc mutation-negative families (6%) differed significantly from that in the BRCA1 (23%, p = 0.0002) and BRCA2 (23%, p < 1x105) mutation-positive hbc families. Thus, although 50% of the hbc families harboured a mutation, about 80% of families with at least 1 breast cancer case diagnosed below the age of 36 years were mutation-positive. About 69% of the hboc families were mutation-positive, and as compared with the 19% of mutation-negative families, 54% of those mutation-positive families contained at least 1 breast cancer case diagnosed below the age of 36 years (p = 0.017). Of the 18 hboc families with fewer than 3 cases of breast cancer, half of the 10 mutation-positive families contained at least 1 breast cancer case diagnosed below the age of 36 years as compared with no cases diagnosed in mutation-negative hboc families in this sub-group. These observations reaffirm the significance of the presence of very young age of diagnosis of breast cancer with hbc and hboc families and should facilitate decisions aimed at genetic testing for BRCA mutations.'),\n",

Our study is designed to estimate the strength of the association between transitional-cell ovarian carcinomas and germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.\\n\\nMethods\\nWe searched our pathology department’s database for cases of epithelial ovarian carcinoma with transitional-cell histology. Patients (or their surviving first-degree relatives) were offered genetic counselling and testing for germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Pathology slides were reviewed and confirmed by a gynecologic pathologist.\\n\\nResults\\nBetween 1996 and 2008, 25 patients with a mean age of 58 years (range: 39–75 years) were identified. Ten patients and one patient’s son underwent genetic testing. The other patients could not be tested because they were either deceased or lost to follow-up. We identified 6 BRCA1 and 2 BRCA2 mutation carriers with a mean age of 57 years (range: 51–63 years). A conservative estimate of the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, including all 25 transitional-cell histology patients as the denominator, identified a frequency of 32% (95% confidence interval: 14%–50%). If we had been able to offer testing to all patients in our transitional-cell cohort, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations may have been even greater.

Until the year 2000, dna analysis was performed using the protein truncation test (ptt). The dna from patients in whom no mutation was initially found using the ptt later on underwent complete genetic screening.\\n\\nResults\\nThe ptt detected 21 mutations (6.5%); complete genetic screening identified an additional 32 mutations (10.4%) and 11 unclassified variants (uvs—3.6%). Compared with cancer history, a threshold of 10% with brcapro or with Myriad excluded about 40% of the patients from analysis, including 4 patients with a mutation and probabilities under 10% with both programs. All 4 probands had a BRCA2 mutation. The brcapro and Myriad methods showed similar specificity at 10% threshold, and overall, brcapro was more sensitive than Myriad.

For the detection of BRCA1 mutations, brcapro, at a 10% threshold, is equally sensitive; however, for BRCA2 mutations, cancer history is the most sensitive.

To date, it has not been proposed that the entire female Jewish population be eligible for screening. However, given the high frequency of mutations in the Jewish population at large, a full-population approach may be rational. Current guidelines for genetic testing in Ontario, Canada, stipulate the family history of cancer that must be present to confer eligibility for testing. Little is known about the appropriateness of these guidelines in the Jewish population and the acceptance of genetic testing in this group of women.\\n\\nMethods\\nEligible subjects were women who self-identified as (Ashkenazi or Sephardic) Jewish, who were between the ages of 25 and 80 years, and who resided in Ontario. Study subjects were recruited through a description of the study that was published in a national newspaper on a single occasion in May 2008.

Scanlan N. Paling T. Ainsworth P. Jung J. London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada9 2009 104 104 Deleterious mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes have not been identified in high-risk families as often as originally expected. In clinical practice, predictions of BRCA1/2 mutation probability are sometimes made using various statistical models. When such models are applied to the same person, a wide range of probabilities is revealed. Although trying to provide best practice to patients, economic challenges also exist in the health care environment. For these reasons, the Cancer Genetics team at the London Health Sciences Centre critically evaluated our experiences regarding cancer risk assessment and our associated BRCA1/2 mutation detection rate. In Ontario in 2000, a provincial committee established 13 eligibility criteria for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (hboc) screening based on the medical literature at that time, offering gene analysis to individuals with a perceived 10% or greater risk of having a BRCA1/2 gene mutation. The methodology of this study included a review of all pedigrees, of eligibility criteria, and of genetic test results of individuals (n = 1270) who participated in index BRCA1/2 testing from 2000 to 2008. A consistent approach to determining which eligibility criteria were used in each case was pertinent to the analysis. The results revealed that one of the criteria (3 or more cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer, any age), representing 48% (608/1270) of all individuals tested, reported a 12.3% (75/608) overall mutation detection rate. However, a subset of this group (3 or more cases of breast cancer, age over 50 years), representing 31% (189/608) of this category, showed only a 2.6% (5/189) positivity rate. Using a conservatively priced hboc screen ($1500), it takes approximately $56,000 to detect 1 mutation-positive individual in this subset. This finding could represent a significant cost savings to the current service testing program in Ontario. Our next goal is to determine if other cancer genetics programs in Ontario experience similar results in their own region, to provide further evidence to influence provincial decision-making.'),\n",

Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is a promising technology for BRCA carriers. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is a type of assisted reproductive technology that involves genetic analysis of embryos obtained through in vitro fertilization. Couples can transfer only mutation-free embryos to the mother’s uterus to initiate pregnancy. However, use of pgd for adult-onset cancer susceptibility is also controversial. As health care professionals increasingly become involved in discussions of family planning and reproductive technologies in their work with hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, the viewpoints of patients may provide insight for genetic counsellors and physicians attempting to navigate this ethically complex terrain.

Sharsheret, Teaneck, New Jersey, U.S.A9 2009 105 105 Cancer genetic counsellors are well aware of the increased risk for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish background carrying a BRCA mutation and of the fact that breast/ovarian cancer is more likely to have a genetic basis in Jewish than in non-Jewish families. What they may not be as familiar with, is the existence of a community of mainly religious Jewish women who are resistant to genetic counselling/testing because of unique issues surrounding their religious beliefs. Some Jewish women may find that breast/ovarian cancer treatments and/or genetic testing present religious dilemmas above and beyond the emotional dilemmas that all women confront with cancer. When faced with a diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer, these women have questions and specific psychosocial concerns that may not be understood by the general cancer community, including genetic counsellors and cancer support groups. Some of their concerns surround issues of community, the Mikvah (ritual bath), and cancer as a stigma affecting marriage prospects. These questions need to be addressed by sources knowledgeable in Jewish lore and practices. A national, not-for-profit organization was formed several years ago to address these unique psychosocial, genetic, and practical issues pertinent to Jewish women living with or at high risk of breast cancer.

In pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (pgd), embryos created by in vitro fertilization are genetically tested and unaffected ones are implanted. This study aimed to determine if couples attempting pgd to exclude BRCA1/2 mutations faced ethical and clinical challenges different from those for other cancer predispositions.\\n\\nMethods\\nCouples referred for pgd for cancer predisposition had a preliminary consultation to outline the process.

Overall, 18 cycles of pgd were completed for 12 couples, resulting in the birth of 5 healthy singletons and 4 ongoing pregnancies (pregnancy rate of 50% (9/18) per pgd cycle started). The largest referral group was for breast and ovarian cancer attributable to BRCA1 (25 couples) and BRCA2 (6 couples). However, only 35% (11/31) from this group opted for pgd as compared with 87% (13/15) for NF1, 71% (12/17) for RB1, and 65% (11/17) for APC mutations. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations refused pgd, because the time taken by the sequential process of funding, protocol development, and hfea licensing interfered with their planned prophylactic surgery. Couples with children rarely chose to have pgd.\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe uptake of pgd for BRCA1/2 is clearly much less than for other cancer predispositions.

The integration of breast cancer risk assessment models that take into consideration gene mutations raises a number of ethical, legal, and social concerns with regard to defining risk and risk categories and communicating risk information to the patient, and with regard to the potential value of the information for family members, the privacy and confidentiality of the information, and the potential misuse of the information by third parties. Thus, utilization of risk assessment models requires awareness of the ethical dilemmas. To gain a better understanding of the information available to the public, policymakers, and health professionals concerning risk assessment models for breast and ovarian cancer, we will review policies and position statements issued by international, regional, and national agencies and the relevant academic literature.

Report of a Canadian Kindred Tomiak E. Smith E. Boycott K. Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada9 2009 106 106 Objectives\\nBi-allelic mutations of the MYH gene, implicated in base excision repair, are known to cause adenomatous colorectal polyps and are associated with very high colorectal cancer risk. The extracolonic manifestations of MYH-associated polyposis coli have not been fully characterized. One previous report suggested a substantially increased breast cancer (bc) risk in female MYH mutation carriers (Nielsen et al.

Important needs were insurance discrimination issues, receiving results in person, risks for self and offspring, and a summary letter and referrals to support groups and research programs.

The clinic provides improved access to imaging surveillance; expert medical consultation; counselling by a nursing coordinator, psychologist, and sexologist; and medical information. Study findings strengthened interdisciplinary connections among participating nurses, genetic counsellors, and physicians, and supported a holistic health promotion model.\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe primary study outcome was inception of a one-stop multidisciplinary clinic incorporated into an existing health care setting.

The session was audiotaped. Themes were extracted and examined.\\n\\nResults\\nRecognizing the different arguments in favour of and against testing young people based on theoretical benefits and harms, the group discussed their clinical experience and their case-based decisions. The adult children were mainly female and came with only 1 parent who was not necessarily the carrier. The prominent theme encountered was to elicit the extent to which the young person’s demand for the test was “voluntary,” that is, being “influenced” but not “coercively” by the parents. This assessment became more difficult by the value of autonomy based on a rational individual, traditional bias on psychological assessment, and the limitations of professional training for the changing demands in this select population. Sex differences in the parent’s perspectives on the daughter’s desire to seek testing and contradictory behaviour in relation to being tested or to receiving the result were also relevant themes for the group.

No significant differences in mean age at the time of genetic testing, number of affected first-degree relatives, history of breast biopsy, or history of cosmetic surgery were detected between the groups.\\n\\nConclusions\\nBRCA carriers with family history of a mother dying of breast cancer were most likely to choose pm. Among those who did not undergo pm, uptake of bso was highest among those whose mother died of ovarian cancer. The impact of having a mother die of cancer may be of under-recognized import in patient attitudes regarding prophylactic procedures.

Previous study has demonstrated that Lycii Radicis Cortex (LRC) extract inhibits bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice by enhancing osteoblast differentiation. A bioactive compound, kukoamine B (KB), was identified from fractionation of an LRC extract as a candidate component responsible for an anti-osteoporotic effect. This study investigated the anti-osteoporotic effects of KB using in vitro and in vivo osteoporosis models. KB treatment significantly increased the osteoblastic differentiation and mineralized nodule formation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, while it significantly decreased the osteoclast differentiation of primary-cultured monocytes derived from mouse bone marrow. The effects of KB on osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiations under more physiological conditions were also examined. In the co-culture of MC3T3-E1 cells and monocytes, KB promoted osteoblast differentiation but did not affect osteoclast differentiation. In vivo experiments revealed that KB significantly inhibited OVX-induced bone mineral density loss and restored the impaired bone structural properties in osteoporosis model mice. These results suggest that KB may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis.\\n\\nosteoporosisherbal medicinekukoamine Bosteoblastosteoclastbone mineral densityovariectomized mice'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\n1. Introduction\\nBone is a living organ constantly remodeled and maintained by a balance between bone formation and resorption [1,2]. Bone remodeling is a physiological condition regulated by osteoblasts replacing new bone formations and osteoclasts removing old or damaged bone [1]. Osteoblasts, which are differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells, play an important role in bone formation by synthesizing various bone matrix proteins and transporting minerals into the matrix. Osteoclasts are differentiated from mononuclear cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, and they break down bone tissue essential for osteoblast new bone formation. Bone formation includes the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts via the activation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen synthesis, and the mineralization of bone [3]. Bone resorption involves the differentiation of osteoclasts via the activation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) [4,5]. The balanced relationship between bone formation and bone resorption is critical for maintaining bone strength and preventing bone loss [6]. However, an imbalanced regulation of these bone-remodeling processes leads to serious bone loss via osteoporosis, a metabolic bone disease [1]. \\n\\nOsteoporosis is a serious condition that causes a loss of bone density and strength, leading to increased, painful bone fractures [7]. Osteoporotic fractures are a serious health problem, particularly for aging, postmenopausal women [8]. Currently, various pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis are proven to reduce fracture risks, including bisphosphonates, which inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts; selective estrogen receptor modulators; the monoclonal antibody to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL); and a parathyroid hormone [9].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Many herbal medicines derived from natural products have been used in the treatment of osteoporosis, with fewer negative effects [10,11,12,13,14,15]. In addition, bioactive components and related properties for alternative treatments of osteoporosis have been identified [16,17,18,19]. The plant Lycii Radicis Cortex (LRC) has been used in traditional medicines in East Asia. Physiological bioactive properties, such as apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, oleanolic acid, dihydrophaseic acid, and urosolic acid, were identified in LRC extracts [20,21]. The authors’ previous study suggested that LRC extract promoted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited the loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in an osteoporotic mice model, without negative side effects [22]. Furthermore, LRC prevented osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL through the down-regulation of osteoclastogenesis-related markers [23]. Recently, dihydrophaseic acid 3′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside was identified as a candidate bioactive compound for the anti-osteoporotic effects of LRC extract [24]. However, because only a small amount of this compound is contained in LRC extract, other component(s) responsible for the bone formation-enhancing effect of LRC may still be unidentified.\\n\\nThis study aimed to identify the other bioactive component(s) for anti-osteoporotic effects in LRC extract. First, a fractionation of the ethanol LRC extract was performed, and then a single compound was isolated. Next, the anti-osteoporotic effects of the compound with in vitro and in vivo osteoporosis models were investigated.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2. Results and Discussion\\n2.1. A Bioactive Component Promoting Osteoblast Differentiation Was Isolated from LRC Extract\\nThe authors’ previous study reported that the ethanol extract of LRC induced osteoblast differentiation in preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells, and prevented the loss of bone mineral density in ovariectomized (OVX) mice [22]. The study identified the 13 main constituents using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–electrospray ionization (ESI)–tandem mass spectrometry system [22]. In the present study, fractionation and isolation of the bioactive component from LRC ethanol was performed (Figure S1). 30% of the ethanol LRC extract was fractionated, and each fraction was investigated for a bone formation-enhancing effect using an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay in preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells for identifying the bioactive fraction (Figure S2). ALP is a homodimeric protein enzyme located in the cell membranes of osteoblasts, and is a reliable marker of bone metabolism during osteoblast differentiation [25]. Therefore, an ALP assay was conducted to screen the bioactive fractions on bone formation. Each fraction was treated in an osteoblastic cell line for three days, and osteoblast differentiation was measured by the ALP assay. Consequently, a bioactive single compound, kukoamine B (KB), was isolated from the LRC extract and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry analyses (Figure 1 and Figure S3). The composition of KB in the LRC extract was 0.657%.\\n\\nKB is a natural spermine alkaloid compound that was first isolated from LRC [26]. It has been reported that KB neutralizes both lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG DNA), and inhibits LPS- or CpG DNA-mediated proinflammatory signal transduction and cytokine expression [27,28]. The biological characteristics of KB on osteoporosis have not been studied.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.2. KB Increased Osteoblast Differentiation and the Mineralized Nodule Formation of Preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 Cells\\nFirst, the effects of KB on osteoblast differentiation in the MC3T3-E1 cell line were examined. Osteoblast differentiation is characterized by three stages: (1) Cell proliferation, (2) matrix maturation, and (3) matrix mineralization [29]. To evaluate the effect of KB on osteoblast differentiation, orthodox methods were used, including ALP activity, cell viability, and mineralization assays. ALP activity plays a crucial role in the mineralization of newly-formed bone and increases during osteoblast differentiation [30,31]. Cells were cultured with three different concentrations of KB (5, 10, and 20 μM), and ALP activity was assessed at two, three, four, and five days (Figure S3). ALP activities in the KB-treated cells (5 and 10 μM) were increased at three and four days, but then decreased at day five (Figure S4). After incubating for five days with KB (5, 10, and 20 μM), cell viability was analyzed using a water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay. A higher ALP activity was observed for the treatments of 10 and 20 μM KB, with increased ALP-positive staining colonies in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells compared to the control group (Figure 2A,C). Treatments of KB of 5, 10, and 20 μM did not affect the cell viability of osteoclastic cells (Figure 2B).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Next, the effects of KB on mineralized nodule formation in MC3T3-E1 cells were examined. Bone matrix is mineralized by osteoblast differentiation, leading to the induction of calcium and phosphate-based minerals. Consequently, bone mineralization develops with several matrix proteins [32]. Many studies have suggested that the mineralized osteoblast is a characteristic method for testing the effects of drug treatments on calcium deposition and bone formation [33,34]. Alizarin red S is a histochemical method commonly used for evaluating calcium-rich deposits in the mineralization of osteoblast cells [35]. Calcium phosphate and osteoblast mineralization with positive alizarin red S staining revealed successful mineralized osteoblast cells in vitro [36]. The MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with osteoblast induction reagents (ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate) for 21 days, resulting in mineralized nodule formation and the osteoblast mineralization of MC3T3-El cells. Co-treatment of KB (10 and 20 μM) with induction reagents presented higher positive alizarin red S staining colonies than for the non-treated control cells. These results demonstrated that KB enhanced the differentiation and mineralized nodule formation of bone-forming osteoblasts.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.3. KB Increased mRNA Expression of Osteoblastic Differentiation-Related Genes\\nThe augmentation of osteoblast differentiation is closely related to high expressions of the key osteoblastic marker genes Alpl (alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme, ALP), Bglap (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-producing protein, Osteocalcin), and Sp7 (Osterix) [30]. ALP is a sensitive and reliable indicator of bone metabolism. Its expression and activity increase during bone formation activity at the site of mineral deposition, indicating that ALP is an important enzyme in the mineralization of newly-formed bone [31]. Mature osteoblasts express high levels of osteocalcin, which is associated with bone mineralization and calcium ion homeostasis [37]. The Sp7 transcription factor regulates bone-forming osteoblasts [38].\\n\\nTo further confirm the effects of KB on the cellular differentiation of osteoblasts, the expression of osteoblastic markers, including Alpl, Bglap, and Sp7, was investigated. Osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell lines were treated with 20 μM of KB. After treatment with KB, the mRNA expressions of Alpl, Bglap, and Sp7 were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Significantly increased expressions of Alpl, Bglap, and Sp7 were observed in KB-treated cells compared to the control (Figure 3). These results suggested that KB promoted the up-regulation of the mRNA expressions of Alpl, Bglap, and Sp7.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n2.4. KB Decreased Osteoclast Differentiation of Primary-Cultured Monocytes\\nThe imbalanced regulation of the bone-remodeling process promotes abnormal metabolic bone diseases, especially osteoporosis [1]. Osteoporosis, particularly for postmenopausal women, increases the bone resorption process because osteoclast differentiation occurs instead of bone formation, resulting in an enhanced risk of bone fragility and fractures [39]. To examine the effects of KB on bone resorption, this study investigated whether KB promoted the cellular differentiation of osteoclast cells isolated from the bone marrows of six-week-old mice. Monocytes from mouse bone marrow were successfully isolated and confirmed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with monocyte-specific surface markers (CD11b antibody) (Figure 4A). Monocytes are capable of osteoclast differentiation under a suitable microenvironment [40]. For the differentiation of primary-cultured monocytes to osteoclasts, cells were treated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (M-CSF) and RANKL. During a period of osteoclast differentiation, the treatment of KB did not affect the cell viability of primary-cultured monocytes of mouse bone marrow (Figure S5). After the induction of osteoclast differentiation of the primary-cultured monocytes, cells were treated with KB (5, 10, and 20 μM) for three and six days, and were analyzed by a TRAP activity assay and TRAP staining. The results showed that KB (10 and 20 μM) treatments significantly decreased TRAP activity and TRAP-positive staining colonies (Figure 4B,C and Figure S6). Next, we investigated the effects of KB on the expression of osteoclastic markers, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Trap), nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1), and osteoclast-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (Oscar). After treatment with KB (5, 10, and 20 μM), mRNA expressions of Trap, Nfatc1, and Oscar were assessed by qRT-PCR. KB significantly decreased the expressions of these osteoclast differentiation-related genes, compared to the non-treated control (Figure 4D). These results indicated that KB inhibited the osteoclast differentiation of monocytes from bone marrow.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.5. KB Enhanced Osteoblast Differentiation in the Co-Culture System of MC3T3-E1 Cells and Primary-Cultured Monocytes\\nBone remodeling is regulated by two processes: Bone formation by the differentiation of osteoblasts, and bone resorption by the differentiation of osteoclasts in the surface of the bone [32]. The relationship between bone formation and bone resorption includes the interaction of various cell types during bone remodeling [41,42]. Osteoclast and osteoblast cells communicate with each other through gap junctions [41]. The effects of KB on bone formation under the more closely physiological conditions of a co-culture system of preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and primary-cultured monocytes were investigated. Previous studies suggested that a co-culture system containing both bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) more closely mimicked the in vivo environment as a cytocompatibility assessment in vitro for bone remodeling [43,44,45]. Consequently, a co-culture system of preosteoblasts and preosteoclasts was established. The osteoblast differentiation of co-cultured cells was induced by the treatment of ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate for three or six days, and the effects of co-treated KB (5, 10, and 20 μM) on osteoblast and osteoclast differentiations were examined. KB treatment increased ALP activity compared to the non-treated control cells, and a higher ALP activity was observed at three days of KB treatment compared to at six days (Figure 5A and Figure S7A). However, KB did not influence TRAP activity in a co-cultured system at either three or six days of incubation (Figure 5B and Figure S7B).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The homeostasis of bone remodeling is maintained by the balance of bone resorption and bone formation [1]. A previous study demonstrated that a co-culture of preosteoblasts and preosteoclasts enhanced both osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation [43]. However, other studies have suggested that co-cultured cells enhanced osteoblast differentiation but reduced osteoclast differentiation [44,45]. In the present study, KB treatment promoted osteoblast differentiation but did not affect osteoclast differentiation in the co-culture system. Although KB reduced the osteoclast differentiation in primary-cultured monocytes (Figure 4), KB treatment in the co-culture system did not affect osteoclast differentiation. This may be due to the increased M-CSF and RANKL in the co-culture media. These results indicate that KB plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation during the bone remodeling process. \\n\\n2.6. KB Inhibited BMD Loss in OVX Mice\\nOVX mice present a reduced bone mass and quality, with significantly decreased BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) [46]. Based on the in vitro study, the anti-osteoporotic effects of KB in OVX mice were investigated. Seven-week-old female ddY mice underwent either an ovariectomy or sham-operated surgery (Sham). After surgery, the mice were divided into four groups: (1) Sham, (2) OVX control, (3) OVX treated with 2 mg/kg/day of KB, and (4) OVX administrated with 5 mg/kg/day of KB (n = 5 in each group). The treatments were orally administered to the mice for 12 weeks, and the BMD and BMC of the right femur were measured at 0, 6, and 12 weeks using a PIXI-mus bone densitometer (Figure 6A). At the end of the in vivo experiment, transverse microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) images of the right femur were scanned (Figure 6B), and the micro-CT images were analyzed for trabecular bone structural properties, including bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) (Figure 6C).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As expected, the OVX mice showed a significantly reduced BMD in the right femur bone and impaired trabecular bone structural properties. The OVX group showed decreased BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Tb.N, and increased Tb.Sp compared to the Sham group, indicating that OVX-induced osteoporotic-bone loss was processed. However, BMC and food intake did not differ among the Sham, OVX control, or KB-administered groups. KB administration inhibited the OVX-induced BMD loss in the right femur bone and restored the impaired bone structural properties of BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Tb.Sp compared to the OVX control group (Figure 6).

The 70% ethanol extract (97 g) was chromatographed on a Diaion HP-20 gel column and eluted with an H2O–Ethanol gradient system to obtain four fractions (A–D). Fraction B (11 g) showed that the most potent ALP activity was chromatographed on an RP-18 column (3 × 55 cm) and eluted with an H2O–methanol gradient (from 90:10 to 0:100, 800 mL for each step) to yield five fractions (B1–B5). Fraction B4 (98 mg) was further chromatographed on an RP-18 column (2 × 30 cm) and eluted with H2O–methanol (from 90:10 to 0:100, 400 ml for each step) to obtain a bioactive component (20 mg) (Figure S1). The structure of the bioactive component was elucidated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR), and mass spectrometry analyses (Figure S3), as well as by a comparison with the previously reported data [26] (Figure S3).'),\n",

Cell Culture and Reagents\\nA mouse MC3T3-E1 cell line was purchased from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in an α-modified minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). Osteoblast differentiation was induced by adding an osteogenic medium containing ascorbic acid (50 ug/mL) and β-Glycerophosphate (10 mm) after allowing 24 hours for cell adherence (day 0). For the primary culture of monocytes, bone marrow cells were flushed from the femoral bones of six-week-old mice with a fine-bore syringe in the presence of 1 mm ascorbate-2-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA). The isolated monocyte cells were identified by immunophenotypic analysis with a CD11b antibody (BioLegend; San Diego, CA, USA), using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA) and FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). Monocyte cells were cultured in an α-MEM medium in the presence of 30 ng/mL of M-CSF (PeproTech; Rocky Hill, CT, USA) and 50 ng/mL of RANKL (PeproTech) for the induction of differentiation from preosteoclasts to osteoclasts [47]. For the co-culture system, MC3T3-E1 (2 ×1 04 cells/well) cells and primary monocytes (4 × 104 cells/well) were co-cultured in osteoblast differentiation media containing ascorbic acid (50 µg/mL) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm). All cultured cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were used at passages 5–10 after purchase for all experiments. The medium was changed every three days.

Measurement of BMD and Micro-CT Imaging in Bone Tissues\\nAfter anesthetization using tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil; Virbac Laboratories, Carros, France), the mice were placed on the specimen tray for measurements. The BMC and BMD of the right femur were measured using a PIXI-mus bone densitometer with on-board PIXI-mus software (GE Lunar; Madison, WI, USA) for small animals, which was adjusted in relation to body weight. Transverse micro-CT images of the right femur were scanned using a high-energy spiral scan micro-CT, Skyscan 1173 (Bruker; Kontich, Belgium), which had a voltage of 60 kV, a current of 400 μA, an exposure time of 400 ms, a charge coupled device (CCD) camera readout of 1280 × 1280, and rotation steps of 360. Reconstruction was performed using NRecon software (Bruker microCT). Two-dimensional axial and three-dimensional images were reconstructed for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Axial images were displayed using Inveon Research Workplace (Siemens) with a spatial resolution of 8.88 μm. Axial reformats were performed to allow slice-by-slice, manual tracing of the contours of the trabecular bone. For the cross-sectional study of the trabecular bone, the region of interest (ROI) measurements of 1500 μm trabecular bone were analyzed approximately 300 μm below the growth plate. The analysis provided information about the main histomorphometric parameters, including bone volume (BV/TV, %), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and spacing (Tb.Sp, mm).'),\n",

Statistical Analysis\\nAll the experiments were repeated at least three times unless stated otherwise, and the results were presented as the means ± standard deviations, as indicated. A statistical software package (SPSS 11.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform the statistical tests. The statistical significance of the differences between groups was assessed by the Student’s t-test. Comparisons of multiple groups were done with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s HSD (honest significant difference) post hoc test for correction of multiple comparisons. A probability value (p) less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. The results were expressed as mean ± SEM.\\n\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis is the first study to evaluate the anti-osteoporotic effects of kukoamine B (KB) isolated from LRC in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that KB enhanced the differentiation and mineralized nodule formation of preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, and inhibited the osteoclast differentiation of preosteoclast-lineage monocytes isolated from mice bone marrow. In a co-culture of MC3T3-E1 cells and primary-cultured monocytes, KB treatment promoted osteoblast differentiation, but not osteoclast differentiation. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that KB significantly improved OVX-induced bone mineral density loss and impaired bone structural properties in osteoporosis model mice. The results suggest that KB may be a good therapeutic candidate for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis study was supported by the Korea institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, Republic of Korea (115007-3, 116162-2), and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (2016K1A1A8A01939208).'),\n",

The two cell lines showed similar cell morphology, cell growth kinetics, and similar lineage differentiation potentials as the parental hMSC line. The expression of KRAB-dCas9 or VP64-dCas9 was controlled by the presence or absence of doxycycline (Dox) in the cell culturing medium.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\n1. Background\\nHuman bone marrow stromal/stem cells (hMSCs, also known as human skeletal or mesenchymal stem cells) are clonal cells present within the bone marrow stroma and are capable of differentiation into various mesoderm-type lineage cells, e.g., osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes [1]. hMSC has been extensively employed to study the molecular mechanisms of lineage commitment and differentiation and to identify novel factors regulating differentiation processes [2]. We have previously employed global methods of proteomics and transcriptomics to identify specific factors and signaling pathways controlling hMSC differentiation [3–6]. However, follow-up studies focusing on specific factors or a signaling pathway have been hampered by the difficulty in achieving stable hMSC lines that either are deficient or overexpress the target genes of interest at a specific time point of differentiation stages. Moreover, conventional viral mediated gene overexpression in hMSC is technically expensive and time-consuming.\\n\\nType II CRISPR-Cas9 system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats–CRISPR-associated 9) is a novel and powerful technology to manipulate gene expression. It is developed from the bacterial immune system for cleaving foreign DNA [7] and is composed of Cas9 endonuclease and a target-identifying CRISPR RNA (single guide RNA, sgRNA). The sgRNA targets a 18-25 base pair sequence of target gene and thus guides Cas9 to specific DNA sites where it creates a blunt-ended double-stranded break (DSB) within the sequence by its endonuclease activity [8, 9]. This DSB induces the generation of mutations that may cause a frameshift in gene coding sequence [10, 11]. Alternatively, it can supply a repair template with homology to the cut site and facilitates targeted integration of mutation or insertion [12].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Besides the direct gene code editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be employed for studying genetic and epigenetic regulation. The Cas9-sgRNA complex can act as a scaffold to recruit different transcription effectors to specific DNA sequences, allowing gene transcription regulation with either transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) or repression (CRISPRi). This function requires disruption of Cas9 nuclease activity by introducing mutations into two nuclease domains (the RuvC and HNH domains) of Cas9 resulting in a deactivated-Cas9 (dCas9) [13–15]. Artificial transcription factors (effector) fused with dCas9 to form the dCas9-effector and then paired with specific sgRNA can be used to target different genes. Different effector proteins, such as transcription activators or repressors fused to dCas9, can differently activate (CRISPRa) or interfere (CRISPRi) in gene expression. In addition, the CRISPR-dCas9 system can be coupled with inducible systems allowing dynamic control of gene transcription [16].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the present study, we examined the possibility of developing universal hMSC lines to be employed for studies of specific gene activation or inhibition. We employed a system where dCas9 is fused with two different transcription effectors for either activation or inhibition of gene transcription. One effector is the VP64 activator, an engineered tetramer of the herpes simplex VP16 transcriptional activator domain, which can activate silent genes or upregulate active genes in mammalian cells [16–19]. The second effector is a transcriptional repressor KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain of Kox1, an efficient repressor of gene transcription [20]. By infecting hMSC with dCas9-VP64 or dCas9-KRAB lentiviral vectors, respectively, we selected and obtained two hMSC lines to be employed for an easy and quick approach for the activation or inhibition of targeted genes by transfecting targeted sgRNA, and we also showed that the regulation of gene expression is inducible by addition or removal of doxycycline (Dox) in cell culture medium.'),\n",

Generation of Inducible CRISPRi or CRISPRa hMSC\\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), hMSCs were transduced with lentivirus expressing dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi) or dCas9-VP64 (CRISPRa), which express the CRISPR-dCas9 fused with gene transcription repressor (KRAB) or activator (VP64), respectively, and the expression is driven from a doxycycline- (Dox-) inducible promoter (TRE promoter) [23]. After lentiviral transduction, cells were selected with G418 for 21-28 days in order to obtain stable expression cells (Figure 1(a)). In the absence of Dox, no expression of dCas9-KRAB or dCas-VP64 was detectable in inducible CRISPRi hMSC or CRISPRa hMSC, but when increasing concentrations of Dox adding into the culture medium, there were rapid and dose-dependent increases in their expression reaching a peak at a concentration of 1000\\u2009ng/ml (Figure 1(b)). To further prove the dynamic control of dCas9 expression in both cell lines, Dox was removed from culture medium after two-day incubation which led to the disappearance of dCas9 protein expression in both hMSC-CRISPRi and hMSC-CRISPRa within 1-2 days (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.2. Characterization of Inducible CRISPRi and CRISPRa hMSCs\\nIn the presence of Dox, lentivirus-transduced hMSC-CRISPRi and hMSC-CRISPRa retained spindle-shaped fibroblast-like morphology of the parental hMSC line (Figure 2(a)). We observed no difference in cell proliferation rate between the cell lines in the presence or absence of Dox in 12 days culturing, as evidenced by determination of cell number and cell viability (Figure 2(b)). Following osteoblast (OB) differentiation induction, hMSC-CRISPRi and hMSC-CRISPRa maintained osteoblast differentiation capacity as evidenced by positive staining for ALP and induction of ALP activity (Figure 2(c)). Similarly, both cell lines differentiated readily to adipocytes or chondrocytes as compared to the parental cell line (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)).\\n\\n3.3. Dynamic Inducible Control of ALP Transcription in hMSC-CRISPRi or hMSC-CRISPRa\\nTo test for regulating gene expression of specific genes in hMSC-CRISPRi or hMSC-CRISPRa, we chose alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene as a candidate for its known role in osteoblast (OB) differentiation of hMSC [27]. One ALP gRNA was designed, and heteroduplexes were produced and transfected into hMSC-CRISPRi or hMSC-CRISPRa, respectively. After delivery in hMSC-CRISPRi, the expression level of ALP showed no change in the absence of Dox; in the presence of increasing concentrations of Dox, the gene expression of ALP exhibited dose-dependent inhibition; this was also confirmed by ALP staining (Figure 3(a)). Conversely, the expression levels of ALP gene and ALP staining were significantly increased in hMSC-CRISPRa in the presence of Dox in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 3(b)).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.4. Regulation of Osteoblast Differentiation of hMSC by Changes in ALP Gene Expression\\nTo further validate the functional relevance of gene regulation in hMSC-CRISPRi or hMSC-CRISPRa, we compared the osteoblast differentiation capacity in hMSC-CRISPRi or hMSC-CRISPRa following transfection with ALP gRNA or negative gRNA (control (Ctrl)). We observed that in the absence of Dox, there were no differences at ALP activities in control gRNA and ALP gRNA-transfected hMSC-CRISPRi or hMSC-CRISPRa (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)), while in presence of Dox, the activity of ALP was significantly repressed in hMSC-CRISPRi or increased in hMSC-CRISPRa, and this was associated with decreased (Figures 3(c)) or increased (Figure 3(d)) ALP staining.\\n\\n3.5. High Efficiency of Gene Inhibition or Activation in Inducible CRISPRi and CRISPRa hMSCs\\nTo determine the efficiency of specific gene inhibition or activation by gRNA in hMSC-CRISPRi and hMSC-CRISPRa, we compared the gene inhibition with traditional siRNA transfection by Lipofectamine 2000 and the gene overexpression with traditional plasmid transfection by electroporation that we had tested before as the most efficient transient transfections in hMSCs. As shown in Figure 4, both specific siRNA and gRNA transfections in CRISPRi hMSC have significant gene inhibition on day 2 (>90%) or day 7 (>75-85%) after cell transfection (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). On the other hand, the gene activation by gRNA in CRISPRa hMSC was shown to be much stronger than traditional plasmid overexpression (31-fold vs 2.5-fold on day 2 after transfection) (Figure 4(c)), and the gene activation by gRNA in CRISPRa hMSCs also lasted much longer: 7 days posttransfection, cells demonstrated 10 times overexpression while the plasmid-transfected overexpression effects disappeared (Figure 4(d)).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4. Discussion\\nHuman bone marrow stromal/stem cells (hMSC) are multipotent cells with the ability to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages. The cells have been utilized in molecular studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling lineage fate determination through targeting specific genes or genetic pathways [3, 5, 28]. Manipulating gene expression in hMSC by plasmid transfection is the most common approach. However, this approach requires specific expensive electroporation instruments or employing relatively toxic chemical formulations, and it usually exhibits low efficiency (usually <25% in our laboratory). Conversely, viral gene delivery is the most efficient way to attain stable gene expression in hMSC; however, this method requires specific laboratory setup, with time-consuming and technical difficulties.\\n\\nIn the present study, we employed CRISPR-dCas9 technology and created two universal hMSC lines to be utilized in specific gene transcriptional inhibition or transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that this technology did not affect the growth rate or the functional characteristics of the cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that regulation of gene expression can be achieved by the presence Dox in culture medium that acts as a “switch” to regulate gene expression. To regulate gene expression, a simple transfection by one sgRNA for targeting gene was enough to obtain either inhibition of target gene in hMSC-CRISPRi cells or overexpression in hMSC-CRISPRa cells (summary as shown in Figure 5).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We employed one transcriptional repressor, KRAB domain of Kox1, an efficient repressor of gene transcription [20], to construct with dCas9 and make the hMSC-CRISPRi cells, and we obtained 60-99% inhibition efficiency using only one sgRNA. To further enhance the inhibition efficiency, previous studies have suggested a number of other approaches, including screening of several sgRNAs to identify the most efficient sgRNA [20]; the pooling of several designed sgRNAs of the targeting gene [16, 29]; or combining several fusion transcriptional repressors with dCas9 in the system, such as KRAB, the CS (chromoshadow) domain of HP1a, the WPRW domain of Hes1, and four concatenated copies of the mSin3 domain (SID4X) [14, 16]. We observed that transfection of sgRNAs in CRISPRi cell system resulted in similar levels of gene expression inhibition compared to siRNA-mediated gene inhibition. This is expected as both are small RNA molecules with high transfection efficiency (usually >95% transfection efficiency got in hMSCs for small RNA transfection in our laboratory). However, sgRNA-CRISPRi has the important advantage of the ability to control gene expression by Dox, allowing gene manipulation at different time points at developmental stages of differentiating hMSC.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We observed high efficiency for gene regulation by CRISPR-dCas9 in CRISPRa our activation system. By simply transfecting one small molecular sgRNA of the targeting gene, we routinely obtained 5 to 20-fold overexpression for the targeting genes in hMSCs. This method is much easier than the traditional approaches for gene overexpression, e.g., transfection or infection of gene open reading frame (ORF) cloning plasmid or viral vectors, respectively. We have utilized the VP64 activator in the CRISPRa cell system. Other activator fusion proteins have the employed activation of gene expression such as P65 activator, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and the viral replication and transcription activator (RTA) [30]. Among these, VP64 infection was proven to demonstrate more efficiency than other reported activities [11]. In addition, several approaches have been described to further enhance gene activation in CRISPRa system, e.g., fusing multirepeats of one transcriptional activator with dCas9 [20, 31]; combining several different transcriptional activators together with dCas9 [32]; or using multiple sgRNAs designed across the targeting gene promoter [19].\\n\\nOne of the most striking advantages for CRISPRi and CRISPRa is the possibility for simultaneous multigene targeting [19, 20, 29]. Through single transfection with several sgRNAs targeting different genes, the method can inhibit or enhance multiple genes allowing examination of the combined effects of multigene inhibition or activation. Moreover, VP64-CRSIPRa and KRAB-CRISPRi hMSC lines can also be employed in screening a large number of effectors by sgRNAs libraries. Combing both CRISPRi and CRISPRa together to study one or several targeting genes by loss-or-gain effects can further help confirming the specific effects of targeting factors and limit the bias of function study.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for creating gene knock-ins and knock-outs; however, concerns need to be addressed consequentially to mutations engendered at gene sites other than the intended target site (off-target). The selection and design of the sgRNA for specific target genes are the key to control the specificity of targeting in our system. We suggest initially selecting several highest scored sgRNAs for the target gene that are designed by different programs. Alternatively, commercially proved sgRNAs (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Merck/Sigma, Takara et al.) are now available. Pooling of several sgRNAs for one target gene might improve the inhibition or activation efficiency of the target gene; however, limiting the number of sgRNAs can benefit the reduction of off-target effects. If one sgRNA has a high enough efficiency, we suggest using one sgRNA targeting for one gene. Several different sgRNAs for one gene can be used in different parallel experiments to obtain consistent results and limit misleading the effects of off-targeted events. Moreover, besides checking the specific target gene, testing the several highest potential off-target genes by the gRNAs can also help to confirm the targeting specificity in the CRISPR cells.\\n\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe availability of inducible hMSC-CRISPRi and hMSC-CRISPRa cell lines makes it possible to investigate the role of specific genes and genetic pathways at a specific developmental stage of hMSC differentiation and map the genetic regulatory networks underlying lineage differentiation of hMSC. These tools can help to enhance our understanding of hMSC biology and are also relevant to regenerative medicine applications for tissue regeneration.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe project got partial support from a scholarship from Odense University Hospital PhD-pulje and the University of Southern Denmark (2014).

The socioeconomic impact of surgical revisions is hugely significant; in the United Kingdom alone, it is estimated that £135m is spent annually on revision arthroplasties. Enhancing the longevity of titanium implants will help reduce the incidence and overall cost of failed devices. In realising the development of a superior titanium (Ti) technology, we took inspiration from the growing interest in reactive polydopamine thin films for biomaterial surface functionalisations. Adopting a “one-pot” approach, we exposed medical-grade titanium to a mildly alkaline solution of dopamine hydrochloride (DHC) supplemented with (3S)1-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-(oleoyloxy)butyl-1-phosphonate (FHBP), a phosphatase-resistant analogue of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Importantly, LPA and selected LPA analogues like FHBP synergistically cooperate with calcitriol to promote human osteoblast formation and maturation. Herein, we provide evidence that simply immersing Ti in aqueous solutions of DHC-FHBP afforded a surface that was superior to FHBP-Ti at enhancing osteoblast maturation. The facile step we have taken to modify Ti and the biological performance of the final surface finish are appealing properties that may attract the attention of implant manufacturers in the future.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\n1. Introduction\\nTitanium (Ti) is a widely used bone implant material. The popularity of Ti stems from its excellent biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and high modulus of elasticity in tension [1]. Total joint prostheses for replacing diseased hips and knees are fashioned from Ti. In the United Kingdom, a total of 106,111 hip and 109,540 knee primary arthroplasties were performed in 2019 (Prof. AW Blom, data analysis licensee for the National Joint Registry). Of these, it is estimated that 7%–8% will need replacing due to aseptic loosening, a major cause of joint replacement failure [2], generally thought to be a consequence of poor initial and/or sustained osseointegration. The impact of aseptic loosening is huge, with approximately 55% of hip [3] and 31% of knee revisions [4] attributed to the problem. Consequently, there has been a wealth of research interest in seeking ways of improving osseointegration. Such approaches include the development of Ti technologies that promote more rapid and superior rates of integration by enhancing, for example, the activity of bone-forming osteoblast cells at the Ti surface [5].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In recent years, we have focussed on a stable lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) analogue as a potential adjunct for enhancing early osseointegration of bone implant materials, including Ti [6,7]. The agent in question is (3S)1-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-(oleoyloxy)butyl-1-phosphonate (FHBP), which we discovered synergistically co-operated with calcitriol (1,25D) to bolster human osteoblast maturation [8]. In a biomaterials context, this bioactive lipid is particularly attractive given its small size and stability; in contrast to much larger, bulkier, protein growth factors, e.g., BMP-2, we find FHBP-coated Ti could withstand autoclaving [7] and 35kGy gamma irradiation [9]. It is also likely, given its structural similarity to related lipids (e.g., oleic acid), that FHBP will withstand prolonged ambient storage (potentially 2–3 years), as would be expected for routinely stored implantable devices. Credence is given to this possibility in light of our recent study, wherein FHBP-coated Ti retained the ability to enhance 1,25D-induced osteoblast maturation after 24 months of ambient storage in air [9].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As part of our ongoing programme to bio-functionalise bone biomaterials with LPA species, we have recently turned our attention to polydopamine (PDA), a versatile reactive platform that is gaining significant momentum in (bio)material design [10,11,12]. Inspired by the tenacity with which the edible blue mussel (Mytilis edulis) attaches to wet surfaces, Messersmith’s team [13] reported on the facile and robust ability of PDA thin films to deposit at virtually any surface, including Ti. The PDA assembly is triggered by oxidative oligomerisation of dopamine, producing indole derivatives that can be further cross-linked or physically stacked by noncovalent interactions [14,15]. The multifunctionality of PDA relies on the unique catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) moiety, which not only can deposit metal layers by reducing metallic ions [16] but also allows secondary surface modification via various chemical interactions [12]. It has since emerged that the interaction of deposited PDA films with Ti is one of the strongest noncovalent interactions to date; using atomic force microscopy, Lee et al. [17] found that the catechol moieties of PDA bound to wet TiO2 with a dissociation energy of 22.2 kcal mol-1. The step taken to functionalise Ti with PDA is unremarkable; simply steep specimens in mildly alkaline (~ pH8–9) solutions of dopamine hydrochloride (DHC) and, within a matter of minutes to hours, robustly bound reactive films form at the surface [12]. Resultant PDA films can then be tailored to carry a plethora of biocompatible, bioactive species to suit the particular application. Alternatively, (bio)material surface functionalisations can be achieved using a “one-pot” approach by combining DHC with the selected agent of interest and then applying the resultant solution(s) to the test surface.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Thus far, the direct conjugation of LPA/LPA analogues to PDA has not been forthcoming, but there are reports that PDA platforms can support the attachment/integration of lipids; liposome-PDA surface coatings have been fabricated to explore the delivery of fluorescent cargo to myoblast cells [18]. Using mica substrates, Nirasay et al. [19] used PDA to support a phospholipid bilayer composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. Most recently, Ding and co-workers developed helically coiled and linear PDA nanofibers using lipid nanotubes as templates [20]. In their “hot paper”, Ding et al. employed oleic acid to enhance the association of the selected lipid with PDA [20]. \\n\\nHerein, we report on the facile development of a bioactive Ti substrate whereby PDA reactive films capture FHBP. Adopting a “one-pot” approach, we initially utilised a tissue culture plastic (TCP) model to help inform further direction towards Ti surface functionalisation, and some of these findings are also presented.\\n\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. General \\nUnless stated otherwise, all reagents were of analytical grade from Sigma (Poole, UK). Stocks of 1,25D (100 μM) were prepared in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. The lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) analogue, (3S)1-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-(oleoyloxy)butyl-1-phosphonate (FHBP), was obtained from Tebu-Bio (Peterborough, UK) and reconstituted to 500 μM in 1:1 ethanol:cell culture-grade water and stored at −20 °C. A bicinchoninic acid (BCA)-based assay kit (Pierce) was from Fisher Scientific UK Ltd. (Loughborough, UK), and the detecting reagent mixture was prepared exactly as instructed on the day of use.

Maintenance of Human Osteoblasts \\nHuman osteoblast-like cells (MG63) were cultured in conventional tissue culture flasks (250 mL, Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Osteosarcoma-derived MG63 cells exhibit features in common with human osteoblast precursors or poorly differentiated osteoblasts. Specifically, these cells produce type I collagen with no or low basal osteocalcin (OC) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, when MG63s are treated with 1,25D, OC expression increases [21,22] and, when the same cells are co-treated with 1,25D and selected growth factors, e.g., LPA/LPA analogues, the levels of ALP markedly increase [8,23,24], a feature of the mature osteoblast phenotype. Consequently, the application of these cells to assess the potential pro-maturation effects of novel biomaterial coatings is entirely appropriate. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 nutrient mix (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mM final concentration), L-glutamine (4 mM), streptomycin (100 ng/mL), penicillin (0.1 units/mL) and 10% v/v foetal calf serum (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland). The growth media (500 mL final volume) was also supplemented with 5 mL of a 100x stock of nonessential amino acids. Once confluent, MG63s were deemed ready for splitting and seeding for the different experiments detailed in this study. \\n\\n2.3. Cell Seeding and Treatment at Control and Functionalised Titanium (Ti) \\nUnless stated otherwise, Ti discs were seeded with 1ml of a 15 × 104 cells/mL suspension (as assessed by haemocytometry) in serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium (SFCM) supplemented with 100 nM 1,25D. Cells were left for 3 days under conventional cell culturing conditions, and the extent of cell growth and maturation was determined using reliable and robust biochemical assays.'),\n",

Functionalisation of Titanium (Ti) Using PDA and FHBP \\nThe steps taken to achieving an optimal PDA-FHBP coating were initially informed using an inexpensive tissue culture plastic (TCP) model. The final surface finish capable of supporting the greatest extent of osteoblast maturation was deemed optimal. Ti discs were individually placed within wells of 24-well plates. Using 10mM Tris (pH 8.8) as the diluent, FHBP was prepared at a final concentration of 2 μM, and a portion was immediately dispensed onto samples (1 mL/Ti disc). The FHBP concentration was informed from our previous work with this compound for Ti and hydroxyapatite (HA) functionalisations [7,25]. The remaining solution was subsequently combined to solid dopamine hydrochloride (DHC) to achieve a final mass concentration of 2 mg/mL, and the resultant solution was dispensed (1 mL/Ti disc) within a minute of gentle mixing. Solutions were left at an ambient temperature for up to 2 h. At the desired time points, the solution was aspirated, and the Ti samples were rinsed with 2 changes (1ml each time) of cell culture-grade water followed by a final rinse (1 mL/well) with serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 nutrient mix (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland).

Biochemical Detection of PDA at Ti Surfaces \\nThin films of PDA can be reliably detected using a simple biochemical test using bicinchoninic acid (BCA), as we have reported recently [26]. Briefly, once coated, the Ti specimens were thoroughly rinsed in distilled water, the residual water was removed and then samples were individually placed within wells of 24-well plates. Sample discs were then immersed in 0.25 mL of cell culture-grade water followed by 0.125 mL of the BCA reagent (as prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions). After a 90 min ambient incubation, sample aliquots (0.1 mL) were subsequently transferred to a 96-well plate, and readings were taken at 540 nm using a multi-well plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, UK) operated from a PC using MARS software. A series of DHC concentrations (0–25 μg/mL) in distilled water enabled extrapolation of the PDA coating, as DHC equivalents, for the different treated surfaces.\\n\\n2.6. An Assessment of PDA-FHBP Coating Stability to a Simulated in vivo Environment \\nA supplementary study was conducted to ascertain if the PDA-FHBP coating was retained at the Ti surface following immersion in serum-free DMEM/F12 for a week under conventional cell culturing conditions. To this end, the recovered conditioned media was spiked with 1,25D to a final concentration of 100nM and applied to established lawns of osteoblasts. The remaining discs were also seeded with osteoblasts in the presence of 100nM 1,25D. Following a three-day culture, both models were processed to determine the extent of cellular growth and differentiation.'),\n",

Surface Wettability Measurements \\nStatic contact angle measurements were taken using the Model 68-76 Pocket Goniometer PGX+ and PGX+ software (Testing Machines Inc., New Castle, Delaware, USA) operated from a laptop computer. Droplets (4 μL) of cell culture-grade water were used to determine the surface wettability of control and functionalised Ti6Al4V sample discs. For each experiment, 4 contact angle measurements were taken for each of three control and functionalised specimens. A total of three experiments were performed, each on different days. A minimum of 36 measurements were therefore obtained for each of the different Ti surfaces.\\n\\n2.8. Raman Spectroscopy \\nTo detect the presence of the PDA coating, PDA-coated Ti discs, as well as blank Ti controls, were subject to Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra were taken from randomly selected points using a Horiba Labram HR Evolution Raman confocal microscope (Horiba Mira Ltd. Basildon, UK) system using an Olympus MPlan N 100X 0.90 NA objective. The Raman signal was excited using a green laser beam (532 nm) at 1% power, corresponding to approximately 0.5 milliwatts, for a 10 s accumulation time. Raman spectra were collected in the region of 500 to 4000cm−1.\\n\\n2.9. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)\\nTo analyse elements on the surface of Ti and functionalised samples, XPS spectra were taken by using Phi 5600 XPS (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, MA, USA). Monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα) beam was used for the data collection. The neutraliser was additionally applied with a ~1-μA current to avoid the surface charging effect on the samples.

The media was subsequently removed and replaced with SFCM, and the cultures were left overnight. The following day, the plates were deemed ready for conditioned media treatment recovered from functionalised Ti surfaces. \\n\\n2.11. Metabolic Profile of MG63 Osteoblasts in Receipt of FHBP and 1,25D\\nMG63 osteoblasts were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well on a Seahorse XFe24 tissue culture plate. FHBP and 1,25D treatments were performed as described above. Cells were analysed using Seahorse XFe Metabolic Cell Energy Phenotype test kits on a Seahorse XFe24 metabolic analyser (Agilent Technologies, Stockport, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Agilent Wave software (version 2.6 0. 31) was used to analyse data from the metabolic analyses, in order to determine basal and reserve glycolytic and oxidative metabolic rates. Each biological replicate was the average of 5 technical replicates of the same experiment. Results were normalised to the cell numbers, as detailed in Section 2.12 below.'),\n",

Assessment of Osteoblast Growth at PDA-FHBP-Functionalised Surfaces \\nAn assessment of the cell numbers was performed using a combination of the tetrazolium compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, innersalt (MTS, Promega, UK) and the electron-coupling reagent phenazine methosulphate (PMS). Each compound was prepared separately in prewarmed (37 °C) phenol red-free DMEM/F12, allowed to dissolve and then combined so that 1 mL of a 1-mg/mL solution of PMS was combined to 19 mL of a 2-mg/mL solution of MTS. A stock suspension of MG63s (1 × 106 cells/mL) was serially diluted in growth medium to give a series of known cell densities down to 25 × 103 cells/mL. Each sample (0.5 mL in a microcentrifuge tube) was spiked with 0.1 mL of the MTS/PMS reagent mixture and left for 45 min within a tissue culture cabinet. Once incubated, the samples were centrifuged at 900 rpm to pellet the cells, and 0.1 mL of the supernatants was dispensed onto a 96-well microtitre plate, and the absorbances were read at 492 nm using a multiplate reader. Plotting the absorbances against the known cell numbers, as assessed initially using haemocytometry, enabled extrapolation of cell numbers for the experiments described herein.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.13. Evaluation of Osteoblast Maturation at PDA-FHBP-Functionalised Surfaces \\nAn assessment of ALP activity is reliably measured by the generation of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) from p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) under alkaline conditions. The treatment of cells to quantify ALP activity was similar to that described by us recently [24]. Briefly, the MTS/PMS reagent was removed, and the monolayers were incubated for a further 5 min in fresh phenol red-free DMEM/F12 to remove the residual formazan. Following this incubation period, the medium was removed, and the monolayers were lysed with 0.1 mL of 25 mM sodium carbonate (pH 10.3), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After 2 min, each well was treated with 0.2 mL of 15 mM p-NPP (di-Tris salt, Sigma, Poole, UK) in 250 mM sodium carbonate (pH 10.3), 1 mM MgCl2. Lysates were then left under conventional cell-culturing conditions for 1 h. After the incubation period, 0.1-mL aliquots were transferred to 96-well microtitre plates, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. An ascending series of p-NP (50–500 μM) prepared in the incubation buffer enabled quantification of product formation. Unless stated otherwise, total ALP activity is expressed as the mean micromolar concentration of p-NP per 100k cells, as extrapolated from the MTS/PMS assay described above.\\n\\n2.14. Statistical Analysis\\nUnless stated otherwise, results are expressed as the mean plus the standard deviation (SD). Data were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for statistical significance. In some instances, unpaired t-tests (2-tailed) were used to compare means of functionalised and control surfaces. P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3. Results \\n3.1. Short-Term Development of PDA Films are Compatible with Osteoblast Viability \\nUsing 24-well tissue culture plastic (TCP) plates, we produced PDA coatings over 24, 48 and 72 h under ambient conditions. MG63 cells were seeded into the different PDA-modified wells, cultured for three days and an assessment of cell growth determined at the end of the incubation period. We consistently found modest, yet statistically significant, reductions in cell numbers for each of the PDA-functionalised TCP wells compared to untreated controls (Figure 1A). The reduction in cell number was approximately 11% (p = 0.01) for PDA films formed over 24 h. A further reduction at around 16% (p < 0.001) occurred for cells exposed to PDA films generated over 48 and 72 h. Extended DHC exposure times generate thick PDA films with greater roughness [27], a feature that can have a negative effect on cell attachment and growth [28]. We subsequently found that TCP wells treated for two hours with DHC resulted in the development of PDA films that were completely compatible with MG63 viability (Figure 1B). We therefore chose a two-hour DHC steeping time in the development of PDA thin films for the remainder of the study. Before moving to Ti, we next examined if a one-pot approach could be taken to functionalise TCP with an FHBP-PDA coating and if this surface modification could support a good osteoblast maturation response to 1,25D. Both FHBP-TCP and FHBP-PDA-TCP supported MG63 maturation, with the latter surface yielding the most superior response (p < 0.001) compared to each of the other TCP surfaces (Figure 2). Indeed, the FHBP-PDA-TCP was approximately 2.5 times more effective than FHBP-TCP.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.2. PDA Thin Films are Reliably Detected at Ti Surfaces Using a BCA Assay Reagent \\nAs reported by us, recently, we were readily able to corroborate PDA film deposition at Ti using the BCA assay reagent [26]. We consistently found that the extent of PDA coverage following a 2-h exposure to DHC was similar for Ti discs exposed to DHC alone or in the presence of 2μM FHBP (Table 1). \\n\\n3.3. Physicochemical Evidence of PDA Deposition at Ti \\nSignificant peaks were present at all of the randomly selected points in the Raman spectra at Stokes shifts around the 1410cm−1 and 1590cm−1. This is in keeping with previous reports (e.g., [29]) for PDA film deposition on Ti (Figure 3A). These peaks were totally absent for the control Ti blank sample. Contact angle measurements taken for PDA-Ti (54.4 ± 3.9°) were significantly less (p < 0.0001) than control Ti surfaces (66.7 ± 5.1°), indicating an increase in surface wettability for the former. The contact angle obtained for PDA-FHBP hybrid coated Ti specimens (55.7 ± 5.8°) were similar to PDA-Ti (Table 1). \\n\\nThe successful PDA coating on the Ti substrate could be confirmed by two distinctive changes in the XPS results. Considering that nitrogen is present in the precursor (i.e., dopamine) of PDA, the increased N1s peak intensity after the coating is the most clear evidence of successful PDA coating on the Ti substrate (Figure 3B). Almost nondetectable N1s (1 at. %) was increased to 5 at. % after the PDA coating (Table 2). The distinctive decrease in the representative element (Ti2p) after the coating is also the evidence of effective PDA deposition. The at. % of Ti2p after the surface modification was decreased from 13% to 4%.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The presence of FHBP in the PDA-FHBP hybrid coating layer on the Ti substrate could be confirmed by the observation of the noticeable high-resolution P2p peak from the sample (Figure 3B, right top). The calculated at. % of phosphorus in the sample was approximately 1% (Table 2), indicating that the osteoblast maturation effect can be significantly influenced by a trace amount of FHBP. \\n\\n3.4. Evidence that FHBP Links to the PDA Matrix via a Schiff-Base Reaction\\nThe high-resolution N1s analysis provides insight on the possible linking mechanism between FHBP and PDA, which is assumed to be a Schiff-base reaction (Figure 3C-E). The N1s peaks were deconvoluted with three distinctive amine functional groups by referring to the previous report [29]: primary amine (R-NH2) at 401.9 eV, secondary amine (R2-NH) at 399.9 eV and tertiary amine (=N-R) at 398.8 eV. As a result, we could identify the primary amine groups (16%) in the PDA structure (Figure 3C), which should be originated from the un-indolised dopamine unit, as proposed by Liebscher et al. [30]. Considering the presence of the ketone group in FHBP, we expected that the Schiff-base reaction can contribute to the tethering of FHBP on the PDA. Regarding this, we confirmed that the PDA-FHBP (hybrid) Ti has a much higher tertiary amine (=N-R) functionality of 14 at. % (Figure 3D) compared to PDA-Ti, which was 8 at. % (Figure 3C). This should be due to the imine bonds (tertiary amine) formation via the Schiff-base reaction (Figure 3E), which strongly supports our assumption.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.5. PDA-FHBP Hybrid Ti Coatings Support a Good Human Osteoblast Maturation Response\\nEvidence of osteoblast maturation was via total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity—specifically, the quantification of p-NP formation from p-NPP. In support of our previous work using FHBP [25], the direct functionalisation of Ti with this LPA analogue generated a surface that was superior to blank Ti at supporting 1,25D-induced MG63 maturation (Figure 4). The increase in p-NP generation for FHBP-Ti compared to blank Ti was significant by approximately 2.2-fold (p < 0.0001). When a solution of FHBP was combined to solid DHC and the mixture applied to Ti discs, the resultant PDA-FHBP surface modification was more superior than FHBP-Ti at securing 1,25D-induced osteoblast maturation (Figure 4). Indeed, the increase in p-NP formation was nearly double (p < 0.0001) compared to FHBP-Ti. The modification of Ti with a PDA film alone afforded no improvement over blank Ti in securing osteoblast maturation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.6. 1,25D and FHBP Drive a Change in the Metabolic Profile of MG63 Cells\\nCell differentiation is often accompanied by alterations in the cells’ metabolic profile [31]. In order to assess the effect of 1,25D and FHBP on MG63 cells, we assessed rates and potentials of the cells for glycolytic metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation using a Seahorse XFe24 metabolic analyser (Figure 5). Our results indicate that a three-day treatment with FHBP significantly increases the basal rate of oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5C) but not the basal rate of glycolysis (Figure 5A). The FHBP/1,25D combination elicited no extra effect on basal oxidative metabolism over the effect of FHBP alone, and 1,25D by itself had no effect on either glycolytic or oxidative metabolism. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with 1,25D, FHBP or a combination elicited a stepwise increase of the total glycolytic capacity of the cells but had no effect on the oxidative capacity. These results indicate that MG63 maturation is accompanied by increased basal mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which markedly increases the ability of these cells to increase glycolytic rates in response to demand.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\n3.7. PDA-FHBP Hybrid Ti Coatings Exhibit Good Stability to a Simulated in vivo Environment \\nIn a follow-on experiment, we explored the retention of FHBP to Ti following immersion of FHBP-Ti and PDA-FHBP-Ti in serum-free culture media for one week under cell-culturing conditions. On completion of the incubation time, the conditioned medium was recovered from each of the different Ti specimens, spiked with 1,25D and the resultant solutions applied to established lawns of MG63 cells. Cells were left for three days prior to performing a total ALP activity assay. Each of the different discs that had been immersed were subsequently seeded with MG63 cells, in the presence of 100nM 1,25D, and, also, left to culture for three days prior to performing the ALP assay. The overall outcome from these experiments indicated good stability of the FHBP coating, whether applied alone or in combination with a PDA film. As expected, the co-treatment of established lawns of MG63 cells with 1,25D and FHBP (positive control) stimulated a robust maturation response (Figure 6A) with the level of p-NP from p-NPP at 243 ± 9 μM compared to 99 ± 7 μM for cells treated with FHBP alone and 25 ± 5 μM for MG63s exposed to 1,25D alone. When MG63 cells were treated with 1,25D-spiked conditioned media from each of the different FHBP-functionalised Ti samples, the level of p-NP generated was approximately 50 ± 12 μM, a modest increase in MG63 ALP activity above 1,25D alone but noticeably and significantly less (p < 0.0001) than the maturation response incurred to FHBP alone. These data suggest that any FHBP losses from the Ti surfaces were of no significant concern. This was supported for the maturation of MG63 cells to recovered, functionalised Ti discs (Figure 6B). Indeed, the extent of MG63 maturation at both FHBP-Ti and FHBP-PDA-Ti following immersion in medium for one week were very similar to the maturation responses of cells to the same surface treatments without prior culture medium exposure (compare to Figure 4).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4. Discussion\\nEnhancing the biological performance of Ti implants could be a solution to the continuing problem of aseptic TJR loosening. Finding suitable agents as Ti coatings could be one route, particularly if the process of surface functionalisation were achievable in a facile, one-step dip-coating process. An attractive feature of dip-coating resides in the ability of a thin film of agent(s) to be deposited upon a surface regardless of topography or shape [32]. In realising this, we took inspiration from research emerging from Phillip Messersmith’s group, namely the application of PDA-capturing platforms for (bio)material modification by dip-coating materials in mildly alkaline solutions of DHC [13]. Deposited PDA films are amenable to further functionalisation with a wide variety of agents, including peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides and noble metals [12]. The independent reports of PDA-lipid interactions [18,19,20] was of particular interest to us because of our work pertaining to LPA/LPA analogues in the context of calcitriol-induced human osteoblast maturation. Co-treating these cells with LPA and 1,25D results in a synergistic increase in ALP [23], a marker of osteoblast maturation and an enzyme inextricably linked to bone matrix calcification [33]. We have subsequently found that the phosphatase-resistant LPA analogue, FHBP, is much more potent in eliciting a maturation response in human (MG63) osteoblasts [8] and, therefore, a potentially suitable candidate for biomaterial functionalisation. When MG63 cells are co-stimulated with 1,25D and FHBP, we consistently find a clear and synergistic enhancement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression. Given that the cells are producing far greater quantities of ALP in response to these stimuli, the metabolic data presented in this report fit with the energetic demands made by these cells as they make their transition to a more mature phenotype.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Herein, we report that a PDA-FHBP hybrid film at Ti was capable of supporting a robust and synergistic 1,25D-induced maturation response of MG63 cells. Importantly, this hybrid coating was superior to FHBP-Ti at promoting osteoblast maturation. As a phosphonic acid, FHBP would be predicted to bond robustly to Ti [34,35]. When we steeped Ti in a 2-μM solution of FHBP, the resultant surface supported 1,25D-induced osteoblast maturation akin to what we have observed previously for hydroxyapatite [25]. However, the extent of cellular maturation was further enhanced when FHBP was applied to Ti in a mildly alkaline solution of DHC. Reconstituting DHC in alkaline solution results in the spontaneous polymerisation to PDA, which readily deposits at Ti [13,17]. Within a matter of minutes, the steeping solution began to darken and, by two hours, had adopted a dark brown hue. We were able to corroborate PDA deposition at Ti biochemically using BCA reagent, as reported by us previously [26]. The inclusion of FHBP in the steeping solution did not influence the amount of PDA deposited at the metal surface. The application of Raman spectroscopy provided further evidence for the expected PDA film deposition. Raman shifts at 1410 cm−1 and 1590cm−1 wavenumber regions are likely attributed to PDA catechol stretching and deformity, respectively, and are in keeping with the polymers’ presence [36]. In addition, the relatively increased N1s peaks from the XPS survey for the PDA-coated Ti provides clear evidence for the successful deposition of PDA. Alteration of Ti surface wettability provided another means of successful PDA deposition; as anticipated from previously published works [37,38,39], the decrease in the contact angle (54.4 ± 3.9°) compared to untreated surfaces (66.7 ± 5.1°) was further evidence for PDA functionalisation of Ti in producing a less hydrophobic surface finish.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Having established that a one-pot approach to Ti modification with PDA-FHBP resulted in a surface finish that was superior to FHBP-Ti in supporting MG63 maturation, we next examined whether our findings might be attributed to FHBP interacting with dopamine/PDA and/or with 1,25D. Suffice it to say, co-treating MG63 cells with DHC (10 μg/mL) and either 1,25D, FHBP or their combination did not elicit a maturation response (data not shown). \\n\\nIn taking steps towards the development of novel biomaterial coatings, it is important to consider the stability of the modified surface. One of the first things to consider, for example, is whether the coating can be retained after immersion in a biologically relevant medium. We therefore exposed the different Ti substrates to cell culture media for a week at 37 °C. On completion of the experiment, the bathing solution was removed from each disc, spiked with 1,25D and applied to established lawns of MG63 cells to determine if any of the recovered media could support cellular maturation. The findings gleaned from these experiments indicated a good attachment of the PDA-FHBP coating to Ti. To confirm that the FHBP was still bound to the conditioned discs, MG63s were seeded onto these samples in the presence of 1,25D. On examination of the maturation responses for cells at these recovered samples, the findings were comparable to functionalised Ti that had not been immersed in media for a week. Collectively, it would seem that very little leaching of FHBP had occurred during the incubation period and that the linkage(s) between the coating and the Ti surface were robust.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Whilst there are several studies reporting on the interaction of different lipid species with PDA [18,19,20], we are unclear as to what binding mechanism(s) might exist between FHBP and components of the PDA matrix. In the study by Ding et al. [20], it was found that the polymerisation of dopamine at lipid nanotubes was enhanced where oleic acid was in greater abundance. FHBP bears some structural similarity to oleic acid and would adopt the same negative charge in our experiments as reported by Ding et al. [20] for oleic acid. Of additional note is the finding that oleic acid will combine with dopamine via an amidation reaction [40]. This reaction has been exploited in the fabrication, for example, of PDA-carbon-stabilised sodium ion batteries [41]. Considering that the unindolised dopamine unit, bearing a free amino group, exists within the PDA structure [30], a Schiff-base reaction between dopamine and FHBP (ketone group) may also contribute to the FHBP tethering mechanism, as we proposed in Section 3.4. Whilst we have no data to the contrary, it is conceivable that the incorporation/association of FHBP with PDA is heterogeneous and could include noncovalent supramolecular interactions. For example, entrapped and electrostatic, with multi-site interactions between PDA indole and pendant amines with doubly anionic FHBP. In developing a carbon sphere electrocatalyst, Zhu and colleagues [42] took advantage of a phosphonic acid-dopamine interaction. An intimate link between the two was afforded by an acid-base reaction between phosphoric acid sites and the amine functional group of dopamine. Given that FHBP is classified as a phosphonic acid, it is tempting to speculate that this bioactive lipid might also connect with dopamine, as reported by Zhu et al. [42]. It is also possible that some catechol complexation or H-bonding with the phosphonate could be occurring to help retain the FHBP, and this will be explored in future investigations.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PDA-capturing platforms are gaining significant interest within translational orthopaedics [43]. There is a tangible realisation that PDA could be a dynamic component in the arsenal towards improving the biological performance and, ultimately, the longevity of implantable orthopaedic devices. Using PDA to capture LPA species at Ti could be an important first step in delivering next-generation bone biomaterial design. \\n\\n5. Conclusions\\nPhosphonic acids have a strong affinity for metal oxides, including TiO2 [34,35], the natural finish of Ti. As anticipated, we were able to functionalise Ti with FHBP, a potent phosphonic acid analogue of LPA. However, when FHBP was applied to Ti in association with a PDA thin film, the functionalised metal was superior to FHBP-Ti in supporting 1,25D-induced osteoblast maturation. The approach we have taken to biologically functionalise Ti is very simple; a facile, dip-coating approach for (bio)material modifications is particularly attractive, since there is no requirement for specialist equipment and the coating process is not constrained to a specific feature [44,45,46]. These are important considerations in realising the fabrication of new implantable Ti technologies, which could now extend to hybrid PDA-bioactive LPA analogue coatings.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.

However, a major challenge of this approach is to identify the causal gene(s) at the observed QTLs. Here, we present a framework for the ‘Prioritization of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs’ (ProGeM), which incorporates biological domain-specific annotation data alongside genome annotation data from multiple repositories. We assessed the performance of ProGeM using a reference set of 227 previously reported and extensively curated metabolite QTLs. For 98% of these loci, the expert-curated gene was one of the candidate causal genes prioritized by ProGeM. Benchmarking analyses revealed that 69% of the causal candidates were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of ‘true positive’ causal genes. In contrast, cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive assignment. We provide evidence that these conclusions also apply to other molecular phenotypes, suggesting that ProGeM is a powerful and versatile tool for annotating molecular QTLs. ProGeM is freely available via GitHub.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\nINTRODUCTION\\nWith the continued application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to human disease aetiology (1–4), the rapid discovery rate of susceptibility loci is far outstripping the rate at which we are able to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the identified loci. This represents a major bottleneck to translational progress. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular, intermediate phenotypes provides a powerful means to functionally annotate and characterize GWAS signals for complex traits in a high-throughput manner. This approach has been pioneered with the use of transcriptomic data to identify gene expression QTLs (eQTLs) (5–9). Recent technological advances have enabled the application of this approach to methylomic (10,11), proteomic (12–14), lipidomic (15) and metabolomic (16–18) data. This catalogue of molecular QTLs, cutting across multiple ‘omic modalities, can be readily queried to elucidate the functional impact of disease-associated variants on the abundance of not only transcripts, but also epigenetic marks, proteins, lipids and metabolites.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A key challenge with these data relates to the identification of specific causal genes at the observed molecular QTLs. Accurate molecular QTL–gene assignments are critical for the meaningful interpretation of the biology underlying GWAS signals and the subsequent design of appropriate experimental follow-up work. There are several web tools available that facilitate the identification of genes most likely to be impacted functionally by either the sentinel or proxy variants tagging a molecular QTL. For example, tools such as the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Annotator (SNiPA) and the Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS tool (FUMA) integrate various positional, regulatory and cis-eQTL datasets, enabling the identification of candidate causal genes using a data-driven approach (19,20). Nevertheless, the sensitivity of these tools, or the extent to which they are able to highlight ‘true positive’ causal genes, has not yet been rigorously assessed. This is largely due to the time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental follow-up that is required to assign candidate causal genes at each individual association locus, resulting in a limited number of trait- or disease-associated variants that have so far been unequivocally assigned to established causal genes. Thus, ‘reference’ causal gene sets for a particular trait of interest, which could be used to benchmark causal gene prioritization tools, are either unavailable or likely to be unrepresentative.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='However, metabolite QTL (mQTL) data represent a unique case in that there is an abundance of published biochemical mechanistic research pre-dating findings from GWAS that have identified and characterized many of the enzymes, transporters and other proteins that regulate specific metabolites (21–23). In addition, this experimental research has been complemented by the study of numerous rare inborn errors of metabolism, thereby further elucidating the substrates and functions of metabolic gene products (24–26). Thus, by cross-referencing mQTLs identified by GWAS with this pre-existing body of biochemical and genetic research, it becomes possible to generate a large, high-confidence, mQTL-specific reference causal gene set, which can be used for the validation of both current and future causal gene prioritization tools.\\n\\nAnother major limitation of these tools is that they are hampered by low specificity, in that they will typically highlight several candidate causal genes at most association loci. This necessitates the application of further downstream prioritization methods or literature review. Therefore, causal gene prioritization tools that are able to facilitate this process in an automated fashion will prove instrumental in refining the overall search space. As an example, the majority of current tools are not geared towards any specific trait or phenotype, relying solely on positional, regulatory and/or cis-eQTL data to prioritize causal genes based on the likelihood that they are functionally affected by polymorphisms at a QTL or GWAS locus. Conversely, by designing a tool that is focused on a specific trait (e.g. metabolites) or trait class (e.g. molecular intermediates), relevant annotation data from publicly available databases (e.g. KEGG and GO) can be leveraged to directly prioritize those candidates that have been shown to regulate metabolites or other biomolecules.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Here, we present an analysis framework and accompanying R script (https://github.com/ds763/ProGeM) for the Prioritization of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs (ProGeM). Consistent with existing tools, ProGeM leverages positional and cis-eQTL data to prioritize genes most likely to be impacted functionally by variants tagging the molecular QTL. In addition, ProGeM integrates information from biological domain-specific annotation data from multiple repositories to prioritize genes involved in the biological mechanisms that regulate the molecular phenotype in question. In this way, ProGeM is able to harness both literature- and experimental-derived information in a quick and efficient manner. Crucially, and in contrast to existing tools, we have also determined the sensitivity and specificity of ProGeM using two molecular QTL datasets, comprising 227 mQTLs and 562 cis-pQTLs, for which each QTL has been assigned a high-confidence causal gene. Informed by these datasets, we make recommendations as to which annotation criteria may be most informative for the identification of candidate causal genes at molecular QTLs.'),\n",

Suitable traits were identified largely through a manual review of all entries from the GWAS catalogue tagged with the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) term ‘measurement’ (EFO_0001444) or any descendants of the term. This analysis focused on small molecules, ions, metabolites, vitamins and other biomolecules not directly encoded by genes such as mRNA or proteins. The source tissue was most often plasma or serum although studies of urine and cerebrospinal fluid have also been included. Where available, full summary statistics for the identified studies were downloaded and peak-pruned to identify sentinel SNPs at least 1 megabase (Mb) apart. Before clustering, there were 2808 sentinel SNPs (P ≤ 5 × 10−8) covering 250 distinct metabolites from these 109 studies. These variants were clustered into 497 loci by collapsing variants closer than 500 kilobases (kb) unless there was a compelling biochemical reason to separate the associated metabolites. For example, nine sentinel SNPs for branched chain amino acids and related metabolites near PPM1K were clustered together, and 21 sentinel SNPs for urate, uric acid and urea near ABCG2 were clustered. However, these two groups were not clustered further, even though they are only 150 kb apart because the metabolites are not tightly linked biochemically and each cluster has its own very credible causal gene. Within each cluster, the variant with the smallest P-value (across all related metabolites) was retained.'),\n",

This generated a median of 20 genes per locus (range 4–92). The final selection of the likely causal gene was performed manually following an expert review of the literature, which was guided by both text-mining and annotation data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Many metabolites are so distinct that only a small number of genes have ever been discussed in relation to them. Examples include 5-oxoproline, here linked to the OPLAH gene that encodes 5-oxoprolinase (27) and manganese, here linked to the SLC30A10 gene that encodes a manganese transporter (28).\\n\\nFor each of the 497 gene–metabolite pairs, we attempted to identify the earliest publication conclusively linking the gene product to the exact metabolite reported or a biochemically similar metabolite. Preference was given to evidence for the human gene, to non-genetic data and to experimental work conducted before the publication of the GWAS.

Briefly, the dataset consisted of 3301 healthy individuals of European descent, who had been randomly selected from a pool of ∼50 000 participants of the INTERVAL study (29). Plasma protein levels were measured using the SOMAscan platform (SomaLogic, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA) comprising 4034 distinct aptamers (SOMAmers) covering 3623 proteins (or protein complexes). Genotyping was performed using the UK Biobank Axiom genotyping array (Affymetrix, Inc.,\\xa0Santa Clara, California, USA), assaying ∼830 000 variants. Variants were imputed using a combined 1000 Genomes Phase 3-UK10K reference panel, which yielded a total of ∼10.5 million variants for pQTL analyses after stringent QC filtering. Overall, we found a total of 1927 significant (P < 1.5 × 10−11) genetic variant–protein associations involving 1478 proteins and 764 unique genomic loci (14). Of these 1927 associations, 555 were cis-associations (i.e. sentinel variant within 1 Mb of the gene encoding the corresponding protein) and the remaining 1373 were trans-associations.'),\n",

We then removed nine sentinel variants with associations originating from SOMAmers known to target more than a single protein due to paralogous sequences. We also removed 16 associations with SOMAmers that led to duplicate (or more) protein associations for the same sentinel variant. Finally, we removed two additional associations for which the same sentinel variants were associated with distinct protein isoforms encoded by single genes. Thus, we used a set of 562 high-confidence sentinel variant–causal gene assignments (Supplementary Table S2) for the purposes of validating the bottom-up component of ProGeM.\\n\\nProxy variant selection\\nWe selected proxies for each sentinel variant based on an LD threshold of r2 ≥ 0.8.

Annotations were generated using the ‘per gene’ option, which considers variant annotations across all genes and transcripts, and selects the most severe consequence per gene with an arbitrary selection of the corresponding transcript. In particular, we made use of the IMPACT rating provided by VEP, which assigns input variants to one of four overarching functional categories as follows: (i) high impact: ‘the variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact on the protein, probably causing protein truncation, loss of function or triggering nonsense-mediated decay’ (i.e. frameshift variant, start-lost variant); (ii) moderate impact: ‘a non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness’ (i.e. missense variant, inframe deletion); (iii) low impact: ‘assumed to be mostly harmless or unlikely to change protein behaviour’ (i.e. synonymous variant, 3′-untranslated region variant) and (iv) modifier impact: ‘usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no evidence of impact’ (i.e. intergenic variant and intronic variant).'),\n",

LD ranges for each sentinel variant were defined as the range between the genomic coordinates (GRCh37) of the left- and right-most proxy variants (±5 kb). In cases where the sentinel had no proxies, the coordinates of the sentinel variant (±5 kb) were taken as the LD range. We also extracted significant cis-eQTL target genes of sentinel and proxy variants from the cis-eQTL data prepared by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (5) (v7), across all tissues assayed (n = 48). Significant cis-eQTLs were defined by beta distribution-adjusted empirical P-values using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05 (see http://www.gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage for details).\\n\\nTop-down component\\nmQTL sentinel variant-flanking genes (i.e. transcription start site (TSS) within ±500 kb of a sentinel) were identified using GenomicRanges (32) and the same Ensembl GTF file as above.

Accordingly, ProGeM is comprised of a ‘bottom-up’ and a ‘top-down’ component that prioritizes candidate causal genes from the perspective of the genetic variant and the molecular phenotype, respectively\\xa0(Figure\\xa01).\\n\\nFigure 1.

The former two methods are designed to capture candidate causal genes that are proximal to the association signal, whereas the latter enables inclusion of more distal candidate genes. Any gene that meets at least one of these criteria is included in the list of bottom-up candidate genes.

Various open-source databases are then referenced to determine whether any of these genes have previously been implicated in the regulation of the molecular phenotype in question, thereby constituting the top-down candidates (Figure 1). The type of databases referenced, and the way in which they are queried (Supplementary Table S3), depends on the nature of the molecular phenotype (e.g. the abundance of proteins, metabolites, lipids etc.). For the purposes of this study, we extracted a list of metabolic-related genes from five databases: (i) Gene Ontology (GO), (ii) KEGG, (iii) Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), (iv) Orphanet and (v) Reactome (Figure 1 and\\xa0Supplementary Table S3).

To formally test this, we performed an enrichment analysis using all non-concurrent candidates highlighted by ProGeM for the same mQTL data (n = 227 loci) as a background set. A Fisher’s exact test revealed a highly significant odds ratio (OR) of 29 [95% confidence interval: 19–43] (P = 8.5 × 10−93), indicating that the odds of identifying the true causal genes from candidates highlighted by ProGeM are greatly improved when picking from the pool of concurrent candidate genes.

The resultant set of ‘nearest-concurrent’ genes identified 177 of 227 (78%) reference causal genes, which constitutes a 4% drop in sensitivity relative to our original set of concurrent genes (187; 82%) but a 9% increase relative to the nearest gene set (157; 69%).

There were no mQTLs tagged by a high impact sentinel in this dataset. We found that this filtered nearest gene set was still significantly enriched with true positive causal genes (OR = 34 [23–51], P = 1.3 × 10−84) (Supplementary Table S8), indicating that the enrichment observed for the complete nearest gene set (OR = 45 [31–67], P = 1.0 × 10−107) was not wholly driven by the genes containing moderate impact sentinel variants.

For this comparison, we used SNiPA to identify candidate causal genes for the reference set of 227 mQTLs (‘Materials and Methods’ section).

Importantly, this dataset only enabled us to assess the bottom-up annotation criteria, as the top-down criteria are not directly comparable across the mQTL and pQTL datasets. Therefore, we used only the bottom-up candidate genes from the corresponding ProGeM output (obtained using default settings) as our background gene set.

This is consistent with previous observations made for this cis-pQTL dataset, whereby the sentinel variants were found to cluster at the TSS of genes encoding the cis-proteins (14). Second, the gene sets containing a sentinel variant of moderate impact achieved the highest odds ratios for both datasets (cis-pQTL: OR = 99 [37–374], P = 4.6 × 10−58 | mQTL: OR = 107 [17–4327], P = 1.2 × 10−16) (Figure 4). Third, the significant enrichment observed within the nearest gene sets from either dataset was only partially attenuated after removing QTLs tagged by these moderate impact sentinel variants (Supplementary Tables S8 and S12).

       " Document(page_content='DISCUSSION\\nIn the present study, we introduced an analysis framework and highly configurable R script for the prioritization of candidate causal genes at molecular QTLs. In benchmarking analyses using a set of 227 mQTLs for which we mapped high-confidence causal genes, we demonstrated that ProGeM is highly sensitive in identifying these genes. In enrichment analyses using this mQTL dataset, we found that proximity-based indicators are an effective means of distinguishing between true and false positive causal genes.\\n\\nUnique features of ProGeM\\nFirst, currently available tools are typically either trait agnostic or aimed more generally at complex disease GWAS data, whereas ProGeM is intended for a specific trait class, i.e. molecular QTLs. This confers a major advantage, as knowledge of the trait inherently enables the incorporation of trait-specific annotation criteria. In the present study, we demonstrated this for ‘metabolism’ as a broad trait class. We note that there are other web tools available that utilize top-down information; however, these tools are distinct in that they rely on either user-input (i.e. Phenolyzer (40)) or literature/text mining (i.e. PolySearch (41), MimMiner (42), Bitola (43), aGeneApart (44), GeneProspector (45)) to generate this information.\\n\\nSecond, ProGeM integrates both bottom-up and top-down functional annotation data sources to hone in specifically on ‘concurrent’ candidate causal genes. In our benchmarking tests, we demonstrated that the concurrent candidate causal genes for a set of 227 mQTLs were strongly enriched with the high-confidence causal genes. These data suggest that there is a benefit in prioritizing concurrent over non-concurrent candidates.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Third, ProGeM has been benchmarked against a large reference set of mQTLs with high-confidence causal gene assignments, which allowed us to empirically verify the validity and performance of our framework. By contrast, the published tools that have been systematically benchmarked (e.g. ToppGene Suite) have used very small datasets of known causal genes, which are most likely not generalizable (46,47). We have made our mQTL reference dataset available to the research community in Supplementary Table S1, providing a substrate for future benchmarking analyses and methods development.\\n\\nGlobal benchmarking analyses\\nOur benchmarking analyses highlighted increased sensitivity to be one of the strengths of ProGeM, having missed only four out of 227 reference causal genes at the tested mQTLs (Figure 2). When we investigated these four elusive genes in more detail, we found that three of them were missed because they are located >500 kb from their respective sentinel variants (rs7542172; AKR1A1 | rs140348140; GLDC | rs1550532; TRPM8), whilst the fourth was missed because it was annotated as a pseudogene (rs7130284; FOLH1B). This potentially explains why ProGeM was unable to capture the curated causal gene for rs10403668. Nevertheless, we were able to achieve maximal sensitivity by modifying two user-defined settings in ProGeM as follows: (i) omit the default filter on protein-coding genes only and (ii) extend the genomic locus from the default\\xa0±500 kb to ±1 Mb.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='It is important to note that the high sensitivity achieved by ProGeM was inevitably accompanied by high levels of ‘background noise’ (i.e. low specificity; Figure 2). This is not unusual within the context of candidate causal gene prioritization tools, whereby the general focus tends to be on ‘prioritizing’ multiple candidates at a locus rather than force-assigning each QTL to a single causal candidate—notwithstanding that at some molecular QTLs there may be more than one causal gene. Thus, in order to minimize the background noise associated with candidate causal gene prioritization tools, there is a general need to be able to apply additional prioritization strategies post-hoc that are both reliable and empirically validated. For example, our comprehensive benchmarking analyses demonstrated that by specifically prioritizing the concurrent candidate causal genes highlighted by ProGeM, we were able to make considerable specificity gains at the cost of only a minimal reduction in sensitivity. This was recapitulated when we compared the performance of ProGeM with that of SNiPA, which relies solely on bottom-up information.'),\n",

Furthermore, the subclass of nearest genes that contained a moderate impact sentinel variant achieved the highest odds ratio of all criteria tested, whereby out of 25 such genes in total, 24 corresponded to a true positive causal gene. Although this relates to a relatively small number of genes from the full dataset of 227 causal genes, it suggests that genes containing moderate impact sentinel variants are reliable indicators of true causal genes at mQTLs.\\n\\nThe general consensus in recent years has been that the underlying genetic risk factors for complex human diseases and traits are primarily regulatory in nature, whilst the nearest gene to a sentinel variant often does not correspond to the true causal gene (48). Notably, both the mQTL and cis-pQTL datasets highlighted cis-eQTL target genes (as reported in GTEx v7 data) as relatively poor indicators of ‘true positive’ causal genes. Further research is needed to assess whether genomic proximity is a good indicator of a true positive causal gene for other molecular QTLs as well as complex disease traits, and will depend on the availability of high-confidence reference datasets.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Current limitations of ProGeM\\nA potential limitation of ProGeM relates to the preparation of the reference causal gene assignments at the 227 mQTL, which could have been subject to bias, such as the prioritization of the nearest genes for the assignments. As outlined in detail in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section, all genes within 1 Mb of the sentinel variants were included for the annotation and in-depth literature review. In support, our findings obtained using the bottom-up component of ProGeM were consistent across both the mQTL and cis-pQTL datasets. The latter reference set was derived using distinct methods (‘Materials and Methods’ section). This suggests that our conclusion, that genomic proximity to the sentinel variant is a reliable indicator of a true positive candidate causal gene at molecular QTLs, has validity.\\n\\nFurthermore, although the overall approach employed by ProGeM and the methods used to curate the high-confidence mQTL dataset were different (‘Materials and Methods’ section), it is possible that some of the databases utilized by ProGeM may have been informed by the biochemical literature used for the expert curation. Therefore, we acknowledge that ProGeM and the curated high-confidence mQTL dataset are not entirely independent of each other, and as a result, the sensitivity of ProGeM observed within the context of mQTL may be inflated. We also note that the KEGG database was utilized both by ProGeM and as a guide for the expert literature review, although KEGG was just one of five top-down databases utilized by ProGeM. Our data showed that this did not result in a biased annotation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Possible extensions of ProGeM\\nLooking ahead, we anticipate the application of ProGeM to molecular QTL datasets from additional ‘omic modalities in the future. This may be directly applicable for lipid QTLs due to the similarities of standardized assay platforms but less so for trans-pQTLs, for example. Indeed, the prioritization of candidate causal genes at trans-pQTLs would call for a different top-down strategy to the one adopted here. Accordingly, we have previously applied a ‘guilt-by-association’ (GbA) strategy towards the annotation of trans-pQTLs (14). Thus, rather than asking whether genes local to a sentinel variant have previously been implicated in a metabolic-related phenotype, we asked whether any local genes exhibit related functioning to the gene encoding a given trans-affected protein, i.e. annotation within the same biological pathway, or evidence of a protein–protein interaction (PPI). Notably, multiple currently available tools intended for complex human disease have also adopted GbA strategies. These approaches work under the assumption that unknown or novel causal genes can be identified on the basis that they must exhibit related functionality to known causal genes (47,49). There is, therefore, ample precedence for GbA within the context of candidate causal gene prioritization.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CONCLUSIONS\\nIn summary, ProGeM is a new gene prioritization tool developed specifically for the identification and prioritization of candidate causal genes at molecular QTLs. We have demonstrated its utility for mQTLs, with one of its major strengths being high sensitivity. We have also highlighted multiple criteria that can be used to prioritize certain candidates over others at a given mQTL. Within the ProGeM framework, we provided evidence that those candidate causal genes with both bottom-up and top-down supporting evidence (i.e. concurrent candidates) represent likely true causal genes. We also showed that proximity to the sentinel variant is a reliable indicator of a true positive causal gene, particularly those genes containing a sentinel variant of moderate impact (i.e. missense variants). Based on our findings, we caution against an overreliance on cis-eQTL target genes, as it appears that long-range regulatory effects at molecular QTLs appear may be the exception rather than the rule.\\n\\nDATA AVAILABILITY\\nProGeM is freely available in the form of an R script at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/ds763/ProGeM).\\n\\nSupplementary Material\\nSupplementary Data Click here for additional data file.\\n\\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nWe thank Parsa Akbari, William Astle, Jessica Barrett, James Blackshaw, Stephen Burgess, Qi Guo, Joanna Howson, Tao Jiang, Mihir Kamat, Clare Oliver-Williams, James Peters, Bram Prins, Jessica Rees and Praveen Surendran for helpful comments on the analysis framework.\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\\n\\nSupplementary Data are available at NAR Online.\\n\\nFUNDING\\nWellcome Trust [105602/Z/14/Z to D.S.P.]; UK Medical Research Council [MR/L003120/1]; British Heart Foundation [RG/13/13/30194]; UK National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

These genes code for enzymes (33%), scaffolding proteins (18%), signal transduction proteins (16%), transcription factors (14%), cilia proteins (8%), extracellular matrix proteins (5%), and membrane transporters (4%). Skeletal disorders include aggrecanopathies, channelopathies, ciliopathies, cohesinopathies, laminopathies, linkeropathies, lysosomal storage diseases, protein-folding and RNA splicing defects, and ribosomopathies. With the goal of evaluating the ability of mouse models to mimic these human genetic skeletal disorders, a PubMed literature search identified 260 genes for which mutant mice were examined for skeletal phenotypes. These mouse models included spontaneous and ENU-induced mutants, global and conditional gene knockouts, and transgenic mice with gene over-expression or specific base-pair substitutions. The human X-linked gene ARSE and small nuclear RNA U4ATAC, a component of the minor spliceosome, do not have mouse homologs. Mouse skeletal phenotypes mimicking human skeletal disorders were observed in 249 of the 260 genes (96%) for which comparisons are possible. A supplemental table in spreadsheet format provides PubMed weblinks to representative publications of mutant mouse skeletal phenotypes. Mutations in 11 mouse genes (Ccn6, Cyp2r1, Flna, Galns, Gna13, Lemd3, Manba, Mnx1, Nsd1, Plod1, Smarcal1) do not result in similar skeletal phenotypes observed with mutations of the homologous human genes. These discrepancies can result from failure of mouse models to mimic the exact human gene mutations. There are no obvious commonalities among these 11 genes. Body BMD and/or radiologic dysmorphology phenotypes were successfully identified for 28 genes by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Forward genetics using ENU mouse mutagenesis successfully identified 37 nosology gene phenotypes. Since many human genetic disorders involve hypomorphic, gain-of-function, dominant-negative and intronic mutations, future studies will undoubtedly utilize CRISPR/Cas9 technology to examine transgenic mice having genes modified to exactly mimic variant human sequences. Mutant mice will increasingly be employed for drug development studies designed to treat human genetic skeletal disorders.'),\n",

Major research efforts are underway to identify these mutant genes and characterize their disease phenotypes. Knowledge gained can guide therapies and provide hypotheses to develop future treatments. As recently summarized (1), “Genome sequencing has revolutionized the diagnosis of genetic diseases. Close collaborations between basic scientists and clinical genomicists are now needed to link genetic variants with disease causation. To facilitate such collaborations, we recommend prioritizing clinically relevant genes for functional studies, developing reference variant-phenotype databases, adopting phenotype description standards, and promoting data sharing.”'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rare human genetic skeletal dysplasias affect about 1 in 5,000 individuals (2) and account for 5% of all birth defects (3). The International Skeletal Dysplasia Society (ISDS, https://www.isds.ch), promotes scientific progress in the field of skeletal dysplasias and dysostoses, meets every second year, and published skeletal nosology summaries during 2001 (4), 2006 (5), 2010 (6), 2015 (7), and 2019 (8). There are presently 441 skeletal nosology genes, with an average of 20 new genes identified yearly (Figure 1). The classification aims to (i) identify metabolic pathways active in cartilage and bone, and their regulatory mechanisms; (ii) identify cellular signaling networks and gene expression sequences implicated in skeletal development; (iii) identify candidate genes for genetic disorders; (iv) facilitate integration of data coming from spontaneous and genetically engineered mouse mutants; (v) help in developing diagnostic strategies; (vi) stimulate the design and exploration of new therapeutic possibilities; and (vii) provide a knowledge framework accessible to physicians as well as to basic scientists and thus to facilitate communication between clinical genetics and pediatrics and the basic sciences (4).\\n\\nFigure 1 ISDS Nosology gene identification.\\n\\nThe objectives of the present review include further characterizations of these 441 skeletal nosology genes and evaluating the reliability of mutant mouse models to mimic these human skeletal disorders.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Historical Highlights\\nShort stature and other visually obvious skeletal dysplasias were apparent throughout human history (9). The discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen (10) was quickly followed by the description of osteopetrosis by Albers-Schönberg (11) and many skeletal dysplasias during the following decades (12). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology, developed during the 1980s (13), permitting quantitation of bone mineral density (BMD), and continued advances in computed tomography (CT), providing 3 dimensional images, lead to increasing sophisticated understanding of bone dysmorphology. The first nosology gene identified was CA2 (carbonic anhydrase 2, osteopetrosis), initially in 1983 using electrophoretic, enzymatic and immunologic techniques on red blood cell extracts (14), and subsequently by genetic mutation analysis in 1991 (15). The first genetic mutation for any human disease to be identified by WES was DHODH (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase), responsible for postaxial acrofacial dysostosis, in 2010 (16).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Nosology\\nNosology is the classification of diseases, which in its simplest form involves symptoms and pathogenic mechanisms. No classification system is perfect and there are often multiple ways to classify a given disorder. At the extremes, “lumpers” and “splitters” prefer few and many categories, respectively (17). Heredity can be X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive. Skeletal dysplasias can affect the skeleton only, or be part of pleiotropic syndromes affecting multiple organs. Mutations of various genes within a molecular pathway can each produce similar phenotypes. Loss-of function (LoF) mutations completely disrupt the activities of their encoded proteins but hypomorphic mutations allowing reduced protein activities occur. Gain-of-function (GoF) mutations increase the activities of enzymes and receptors and produce different phenotypes than LoF mutations. Dominant-negative mutations adversely affect functions of wild-type proteins. Mutations can occur within the protein-coding region of the genome (exome), within introns, or between gene coding regions. Mutations include deletions, duplications, and inversions.'),\n",

Skeletal disorders involving aggrecanopathies (13), channelopathies (21), ciliopathies (22, 23), cohesinopathies (24), lamiopathies (25), linkeropathies (26), protein-folding defects (27), ribosomopathies (28), spliceosomopathies (29), and transcription factors (30) show the importance of pathways not often thought to be involved in bone development.\\n\\nSkeletal Disorder Vignettes\\nThis section briefly summarizes selected skeletal disorders resulting from various mutations, highlighting the wide range of transcription and translation events that can be disrupted.\\n\\nMutations can be benign with healthy nutrition but produce disease when key nutrients are lacking. All humans have an inactivating mutation in GULO, encoding an enzyme involved in the synthesis of ascorbic acid, and develop scurvy without sufficient dietary intake of vitamin C. The ascorbate synthetic pathway, involving aldehyde and aldose reductases, was only fully characterized in 2010 (31). Ascorbic acid is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen and disruption of the mouse gulonolactone oxidase gene results in spontaneous bone fractures (32). Similarly, human and mouse HAAO and KYNU genes are involved in the synthesis of the enzymatic cofactor NAD and inactivating mutations in these human and mouse genes can result in congenital malformations (33).'),\n",

X-inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in women by long non-coding RNA specific transcript XIST occurs, but about 20% of X chromosome genes escape this inactivation (34). AMER1 and PORCN are X-linked genes that code for components of the WNT signaling pathway, with dominant mutations in women causing osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis and focal dermal hypoplasia (including osteopathia striata), respectively. Due to developmental lethality male patients are extremely rare, but a few males having post-zygotic mosaic mutations have been identified (35, 36). Amer1 mutations in mice disrupt bone architecture (37) and treating adult mice with inhibitors of the PORCN enzyme reduces bone mass (38).\\n\\nSomatic gene mutations in 11 genes (AKT1, FLBN, GNAS, GREM1, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, MAP2K1, NOTCH2, NRAS, PIK3CA) arise in the developing zygote and are not transmitted genetically. Loeys-Dietz syndrome includes several skeletal dysplasias and can result from mutations in SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2 and 75% of affected subjects have somatic mutations (39). Melorheostotic, dense hyperostotic bone lesions are caused by somatic mosaic mutations in KRAS (40) and MAP2K1 (41). MAP2K1 mutations are thought to arise after the formation of dorso-ventral plane (42). KRAS and MAP2K1 are not included among the 441 Nosology disorders. Mutations in COL11A1, EZH2, and MET can be either germline or somatic.\\n\\nDeleterious mutations can occur at multiple sites within genes.

Multiple neonatal bone fractures were observed due to maternal hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency (59).\\n\\nHeredity of Bone Mass Without Skeletal Dysplasia\\nOsteoporosis is a common skeletal disease in which reduced amounts of otherwise normal bone lead to fragility and fractures. Adult bone mass, even within the normal range, has a strong heredity influence (60, 61) and identifying the genes involved in bone mass accumulation during growth and loss during aging has received great interest within the context of the etiology and treatment of osteoporosis. GWAS studies over the past decade described an increasing number of genes affecting BMD, with 518 loci identified in the 2019 UK Biobank analysis (62). Juvenile osteoporosis, although not a true dysplasia as bone architecture is normal, usually has genetic causes (63, 64). There are healthy subjects with unexplained high bone mass (65, 66) and attempts are underway to identify the genes responsible. Recent discoveries of such genes include LRP6 (67) and SMAD9 (68).\\n\\nMouse Models\\nAll models are wrong, but some are less imperfect than others, and many are useful - George Box'),\n",

Major challenges in the management of epilepsy include its diagnosis and treatment. To date, video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is the gold-standard diagnostic method, with no molecular biomarker in routine clinical use. Moreover, treatment based on anti-seizure medications (ASMs) remains ineffective in 30% of patients, and, even if seizure-suppressive, lacks disease-modifying potential. Current epilepsy research is, therefore, mainly focussed on the identification of new drugs with a different mechanism of action effective in patients not responding to current ASMs. The vast heterogeneity of epilepsy syndromes, including differences in underlying pathology, comorbidities and disease progression, represents, however, a particular challenge in drug discovery. Optimal treatment most likely requires the identification of new drug targets combined with diagnostic methods to identify patients in need of a specific treatment. Purinergic signalling via extracellularly released ATP is increasingly recognized to contribute to brain hyperexcitability and, consequently, drugs targeting this signalling system have been proposed as a new therapeutic strategy for epilepsy. Among the purinergic ATP receptors, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) has attracted particular attention as a novel target for epilepsy treatment, with P2X7Rs contributing to unresponsiveness to ASMs and drugs targeting the P2X7R modulating acute seizure severity and suppressing seizures during epilepsy. In addition, P2X7R expression has been reported to be altered in the brain and circulation in experimental models of epilepsy and patients, making it both a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target. The present review provides an update on the newest findings regarding P2X7R-based treatments for epilepsy and discusses the potential of P2X7R as a mechanistic biomarker.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmc1. Introduction and Shortcomings in Epilepsy Treatment\\n\\nEpilepsy is one of the most common chronic brain diseases, affecting up to 70 million people worldwide. It has an incidence rate of approximately 1–2%, which is higher in low-middle-income countries compared to high-middle-income countries [1,2,3]. While affecting people of all ages, epilepsy is most common among the young and elderly, with a slightly higher prevalence in men compared to women. Major challenges of epilepsy include its diagnosis and treatment, social disadvantages (e.g., unemployment, stigma) and the increased risks of premature mortality (up to 3-fold) and co-morbidities (up to 8-fold), such as depression and anxiety [1,2,4,5]. This imposes a particular high burden on patients and makes societal costs of epilepsy one of the highest for any neurological disease [6].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Epilepsy can be acquired after an injury to the brain (e.g., traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, infection, an episode of prolonged seizures (e.g., status epilepticus)) or can be caused by genetic abnormalities (e.g., polymorphisms, copy number variations or de novo mutations) [7,8]. Epileptogenesis, triggered following a precipitating injury to the brain, is the process of turning a normal healthy brain into a brain experiencing epileptic seizures. Pathological changes occurring during epileptogenesis and beyond the occurrence of the first epileptic seizure include ongoing neurodegeneration, aberrant synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammation [7,9]. Among these, mechanisms driving neuroinflammatory processes have attracted particular attention as potential drug targets [10]. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which can be acquired after a brain injury, is the most common form of epilepsy in adults and involves structures within the limbic system, including the amygdala and hippocampus [11]. The most common pathological finding in the brain of TLE patients is hippocampal sclerosis, characterized by selective neuronal loss and reactive gliosis [12]. Of note, TLE remains the most common studied epilepsy type in the setting of purinergic signalling, in particular involving the P2X7R receptor, as discussed within the following sections.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Frontline treatment for epilepsy is based on anti-seizure medications (ASMs), which are mainly focused on targeting synaptic transmission (glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ion channels (Na+/Ca2+ channels)) [13]. However, despite the availability of over 25 ASMs in clinical use, drug refractoriness among patients remains at approximately 30%. Moreover, even if effective in suppressing seizures, ASMs have no proven effect in modifying disease progression and can cause serious side effects (e.g., drowsiness, agitation, headaches) [2,14]. There is, therefore, a pressing need to identify new druggable targets with a different mechanism of action with treatments effective in drug-refractory patients, with disease-modifying potential and causing less adverse side effects.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In addition to difficulties in treatment, the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy is complex and remains a clinical challenge. The diagnosis of epilepsy requires at least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 h apart, including cases with one seizure and a high likelihood of having additional seizures (more than 60%) or the diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy can be classified into three levels: seizure type, epilepsy and epilepsy syndrome, with a strong emphasis on etiology and comorbidities [15,16,17]. To date, the gold standard for epilepsy diagnosis is with long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) video recordings. This is, however, very costly, has low throughput and is not always available as primary healthcare [17]. This not only causes difficulties in identifying people with epilepsy but also differentiating epilepsy syndromes from similar conditions, such as convulsive syncope or psychogenic non-epileptic attacks [18,19]. This can further lead to wrong or unnecessary treatments with the additional risk of drug-induced adverse side effects. Moreover, there are no markers to identify patients at risk of developing epilepsy after, for example, an injury to the brain (e.g., TBI). There is, therefore, a strong need to develop easy-to-use and affordable diagnostic methods (e.g., biomarkers), which would not only support the diagnosis of epilepsy but also assess disease progression. Epilepsy biomarkers would also help in the monitoring of therapeutic effects, therapeutic trial designs and decision making when prescribing seizure-suppressive or anti-epileptogenic drugs and could be used to identify patients who would most likely benefit from a specific treatment (personalized medicine).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Purinergic signalling via adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is increasingly recognized as a new therapeutic target for epilepsy. This includes ATP receptors, such as the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) [20], as discussed in detail within this review, and other components of the ATP signalling cascade, including ATP release mechanisms (e.g., Pannexin-1 channels) [21] or ATP-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP)) [22]. Notably, data also suggest a diagnostic potential in the purinergic signalling system for seizures and epilepsy [23], making this signalling system particularly suited for the management of epilepsy and its treatment.\\n\\n2. ATP Signalling via the P2X7R\\n\\nOver the past decade, ATPergic signalling via purinergic P2 receptors has established itself as a major player in epilepsy pathology, with increasing data showing its effectiveness as a novel therapeutic target [24,25]. Aside from its role in metabolism, ATP acting as a signalling molecule was proposed in the seminal work by Geoffrey Burnstock in 1972 [26]. To date, signalling mediated via purinergic P2 receptors has been described to be involved in mostly all cellular processes in the brain, including modulating neurotransmission, cell death, proliferation and differentiation, neuron–glia communication and neuroinflammation [27,28,29,30].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The purinergic signalling system encompasses the synthesis and release of purine nucleosides and nucleotides (e.g., adenosine, ATP), purinergic receptors, as well as the machinery to eliminate purine molecules from the extracellular space [31]. Usually present at low extracellular concentrations (nanomolar range), extracellular ATP concentrations can rise dramatically during pathological conditions into the millimolar range [32], where ATP acts as an endogenous ‘danger’ signal, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [33]. ATP can be released via exocytotic mechanisms, such as via the Cl−-dependent vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) [34,35], or via non-exocytotic mechanisms, including voltage-dependent anion channels [36], ATP-binding cassette transporters [37,38], purinergic P2 receptors (e.g., P2X7R [39]) or via channels, such as connexins and pannexins [40,41] or, due to its huge concentration gradient between the intra- and extracellular space, passively through damaged cell membranes [42,43].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Evidence suggesting increased extracellular ATP concentrations following seizures and during epilepsy stems from studies using acute recordings from brain slices and measurements carried out in in vivo models of epilepsy (e.g., [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]). Here, a study by Dona et al. reported increased extracellular ATP concentrations following epileptic seizures using a rat model of intraperitoneal (i.p.) pilocarpine. Interestingly, while other purines, such as adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine, were also increased extracellularly post-status epilepticus, this was not the case for ATP [49]. Likewise, no increase in extracellular ATP levels has been observed following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in rats [48]. Progress has also been made in the identification of ATP release mechanisms during seizures, with a particular focus on the Pannexin-1 channel [21]. This includes evidence from a study where rat hippocampal slices were treated with a glutamate agonist ((S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine) [47]. In another study, which was carried out in resected tissue from patients, Dossie et al. [21] showed that extracellular ATP concentrations increased by 80% during high K+-induced ictal discharges, which were suppressed by blocking Pannexin-1. Of note, the same authors showed potent anticonvulsive effects when blocking Pannexin-1 during kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures in mice [21].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ATP-sensitive purinergic receptors include the cationic, trimeric P2X membrane receptor (P2XR) family and the metabotropic P2Y membrane receptors (P2YRs) [52,53]. The P2XR family comprises seven subunits (P2X1-7), with each P2XR subunit consisting of two membrane-spanning domains (TM1 and TM2), with an intracellular N- and C-terminus. P2XRs form a trimeric ligand-gated ion channel that can be either homomeric or heteromeric according to the recruitment of identical or diverse receptor subtypes. P2XRs are all activated by ATP, thereby allowing for the passage of positively charged ions, such as Na+, Ca2+ and K+ [54]. The metabotropic P2YR family is composed of eight subunits (P2Y1,2,4,6,8,11,12,14) that have the typical seven-transmembrane segment of G-protein-coupled receptors, which are activated by ATP (P2Y2, P2Y11), ADP (P2Y1, P2Y12 and P2Y13), uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP)/uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP) (P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6) and UDP-glucose (P2Y14). For a more detailed description of P2YRs, please refer to [52,55] or other reviews written on this topic.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nWhile data generated over the past decade have demonstrated a role for both P2X and P2YRs during seizures and epilepsy [24,25,56,57,58], most studies have focused, by far, on P2XRs, particularly on P2X7R. Initially termed ATP4− or P2Z receptor and characterized on cells of the immune system, such as mast cells, lymphocytes or macrophages [59,60,61], P2X7R is now recognized to be expressed and functional throughout the body, including the brain. There are several reasons making the P2X7R a particularly attractive therapeutic target for brain diseases such as epilepsy. Among the P2XRs, P2X7R has a relatively low affinity for ATP (EC50 ≥ 100 μM, activation threshold: 0.3–0.5\\u2009mM), suggesting P2X7R activation occurs mainly under conditions of high ATP release, restricted to the pathological focus. As a result, P2X7R-based treatments are hoped to lead to less adverse side effects when compared to current treatments (e.g., ASMs). Most importantly, however, P2X7R is a key driver of inflammation [62,63,64]. P2X7Rs have been shown to contribute to the activation and proliferation of microglia [65] and are key regulators of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, inducing the release of inflammatory signalling molecules, such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) [66,67,68,69]. P2X7Rs are expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including brain areas previously implicated in epilepsy development, such as the frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, where they have been reported to be functional on all cell types. However, while its expression on microglia and oligodendrocytes is well-established, whether P2X7Rs are expressed on neurons and astrocytes remains a matter of debate [70,71]. P2X7Rs participate in numerous intracellular signalling pathways in addition to inflammation activated during epilepsy, including the modulation of neurotransmitter release (e.g., glutamate), cell death, BBB opening and synaptic plasticity [71,72,73,74,75]. It is, however, mainly their effects on inflammation and microglia activation [65] that have generated strong interest, including from academia and industry. This has resulted in the generation of new transgenic models, important for a better understanding of P2X7R-mediated signalling during normal physiology and disease (e.g., enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-P2X7R reporter mice [76]), and the development of several highly specific, BBB-permeable and brain-stable P2X7R antagonists [77,78], critical to advance P2X7R-based treatments towards a clinical application for brain diseases.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3. The Role of P2X7Rs during Seizures and Epilepsy\\n\\nOver the past few decades, a substantial body of evidence has been accumulated demonstrating a role for P2X7R during seizure generation and epilepsy with data stemming from both experimental models of epilepsy and patients [24,57]. More recent data also show the diagnostic potential of P2X7R signalling [23]. Since several reviews on the therapeutic potential of targeting P2X7R during seizures and epilepsy have been published recently (e.g., [24,57,58]), the present review will mainly focus on the diagnostic potential of P2X7R signalling for epilepsy. This will, however, be preceded by a brief description on what is known regarding the cell-type-specific expression changes in P2X7Rs during epilepsy and the anticonvulsant and anti-epileptic potential of drugs targeting P2X7Rs.\\n\\n3.1. P2X7R Expression following Seizures and during Epilepsy'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nP2X7R expression has been analysed following acute seizures (i.e., status epilepticus) and during epilepsy in brain tissue of several experimental rodent models and human brain tissue. While broad consensus exists regarding its overall expression changes (i.e., up-regulation), less agreement exists regarding its cell-type-specific expression. P2X7R expression has consistently been found to be increased at the transcriptional and protein level in the hippocampus and cortex following pilocarpine (i.p.) and KA (i.p., intra-amygdala, intra-hippocampal)-induced status epilepticus in rats and mice, shortly following status epilepticus and during epilepsy [79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87]. However, while studies using i.p. KA-treated mice and pilocarpine-treated rats have suggested P2X7R to be up-regulated mainly on microglia shortly following status epilepticus [80,88], other studies using different seizure models, including i.p. pilocarpine in rats and intra-amygdala KA in mice, suggested a neuronal up-regulation in the hippocampus (e.g., mossy fibres, granule cells of the dentate gyrus) and cortex [81,83,84,85]. This also includes a study where status epilepticus was triggered via intra-amygdala KA in 10-day-old rat pups [89]. P2X7R expression was also found to be increased on neuronal progenitor cells following status epilepticus induced via i.p. pilocarpine in mice [90]. Neuronal expression of P2X7R has, however, been questioned using a P2X7R reporter mouse, where P2X7R is fused to EGFP [76]. Here, P2X7R-EGFP was expressed on microglia and oligodendrocytes post-intra-amygdala KA; however, no co-localization was observed for P2X7R-EGFP with neurons [87]. No P2X7R expression was found on astrocytes [87]. Of note, using the same P2X7R-EGFP reporter mouse, Morgan et al. found widespread changes in P2X7R expression following intra-amygdala KA-induced status epilepticus throughout the brain (acute and epilepsy), suggesting that the P2X7R acts as a common pathological factor in the brain, possibly contributing to the widespread inflammation and damage seen in TLE [87]. Evidence of P2X7R expression changes also occurring in humans stems from studies analysing resected brain tissue from drug-refractory TLE patients after epilepsy surgery. This confirmed increased P2X7R expression in the hippocampus [85,91,92] and cortex [84]. The cell-type-specific expression pattern in human epilepsy has, however, not been analysed to date.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='With regard to the mechanisms which regulate P2X7R expression in the brain during seizures, a study carried out by us using the intra-amygdala KA mouse model suggested P2X7R transcription being, at least partly, under the control of the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) [86]. P2X7R expression seems to be, however, also controlled at the post-transcriptional level, involving the targeting of P2rx7 mRNA by microRNA-22, which is also under the control of Sp1 [86]. Here, we showed that elevated Ca2+ concentrations, due to status epilepticus, blocked the binding of Sp1 to the promoter of microRNA-22, thereby disinhibiting the suppression of P2rx7 mRNA translation into protein, leading, in turn, to increased P2X7R expression [86].\\n\\nIn summary, while it is well established that P2X7R expression increases on microglia post-status epilepticus and during epilepsy, where it possibly contributes to pro-inflammatory signalling in the brain, whether P2X7R expression also changes in astrocytes and neurons remains to be determined.\\n\\n3.2. The Role of P2X7R Signalling during Seizures and Epilepsy'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Over the past decade, numerous studies have investigated the anticonvulsant, antiepileptogenic and antiepileptic potential of drugs targeting P2X7R (Table 1). As mentioned before, in the majority of cases, the models of choice were models which mimic TLE and where epilepsy development is triggered via chemically induced prolonged damaging seizures (i.e., status epilepticus). This includes models where status epilepticus is triggered via a systemic injection of pilocarpine or KA or models where KA is injected directly into the brain (e.g., intra-amygdala, intra-hippocampal). Other, less frequent models used were models of acute, non-damaging seizures. This includes the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) model and models where seizures are elicited via electrical stimulation (e.g., 6 Hz model and electroshock seizure threshold). A more detailed description of experimental models used for the study of P2X7R signalling during epilepsy can be found here [93,94,95,96,97].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='P2X7R antagonism has been shown to reduce seizure severity in the intra-amygdala and intrahippocampal KA mouse model and the coriaria lactone-induced status epilepticus mouse model [83,84,101,105]. On the contrary, P2X7R antagonism has been shown to promote seizures in the i.p. pilocarpine model of status epilepticus [90,111]. In contrast to seizures, however, P2X7R antagonism has been shown to protect against seizure-induced cell death and reduce neuroinflammation in both KA-induced and pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus models [83,90,112]. Notably, P2X7R antagonism also reduced seizure severity in a mouse model of hypoxia-induced neonatal seizures [98,106] and a model of early life seizures in rat pups [89], suggesting that the observed anticonvulsive effects are not age-dependent. No, or only weak, effects of P2X7R antagonism were observed on non-damaging seizures. This included the PTZ seizure threshold, maximal electroshock seizure threshold and 6 Hz psychomotor seizure threshold test [104,108]. Likewise, no effects of P2X7R antagonism on seizures were observed in WAG/Rij rats, an inbred strain with genetic absence epilepsy [102].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nIn contrast to acute seizures, results from models of epileptogenesis and epilepsy are more consistent with P2X7R antagonism, typically reducing seizure severity or suppressing seizures. P2X7R antagonism decreased the mean kindling score using the PTZ kindling model in rats [108,110], and treatment with P2X7R-targeting siRNA delayed the emergence of the first seizure and reduced the frequency and severity of seizures in the i.p. pilocarpine rat model [103]. In addition, P2X7R antagonisms applied after hypoxia-induced seizures in mouse pups reduced long-lasting brain hyperexcitability [98], further suggesting anti-epileptogenic potential. In the same line, P2X7R antagonism during epilepsy reduced seizure severity without altering the frequency of seizures in a model where epilepsy was induced via i.p. KA in rats [107]. Using the intra-amygdala KA mouse model, we showed that P2X7R antagonism reduced the total number of seizures during treatment in epileptic mice. These effects persisted beyond drug withdrawal, implying disease-modifying potential [85]. Of note, previous research has shown that mice, where epilepsy was induced via intra-amygdala KA, are partially resistant to ASMs [114], suggesting P2X7R antagonists as a possible treatment option for drug-refractory epilepsy. Further evidence supporting a role for P2X7R during epilepsy development stems from a study where mice were treated with inhibitors against microRNA-22, previously shown to target P2rx7 mRNA [109]. These mice presented increased hippocampal P2X7R expression and developed a more severe epileptic phenotype. This was accompanied by increased cytokine release and astrogliosis [109]. Finally, a recent study analysed the epileptic phenotype in mice transgenic for the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). These mice develop epilepsy after 7 months of age, including increased microgliosis [99]. When treated with P2X7R antagonists, PPI transgenic mice experienced fewer seizures, further supporting the antiepileptogenic potential of P2X7R antagonism. Taken together, while both anti- and proconvulsive effects of P2X7R antagonism on acute seizures have been reported, broader consensus exists regarding its effects on epilepsy development and established epilepsy where the main finding was P2X7R antagonism-mediated seizure suppression.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Unresponsiveness to ASMs remains one of the most pressing challenges in the treatment of status epilepticus and epilepsy, with increasing evidence suggesting neuroinflammatory pathways contributing to drug refractoriness [115]. In line with P2X7R contributing to unresponsiveness to ASMs, we have recently shown that mice overexpressing P2X7Rs were less responsive to several anticonvulsants (lorazepam, midazolam, phenytoin and carbamazepine) during status epilepticus [100]. Suggesting these effects to be mediated via P2X7R driving inflammation, in the same study, we showed that (i) P2X7R expression was increased in microglia during drug-refractory status epilepticus, (ii) microglia in P2X7R-overexpressing mice presented a pro-inflammatory phenotype during status epilepticus and (iii) that the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline restored normal responsiveness to anticonvulsants in P2X7R-overexpressing mice [100]. In addition, and further suggesting these effects to be mediated via inflammation, pre-treatment with the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased not only P2X7R expression in the brain but also decreased the responsiveness of mice to anticonvulsants. LPS-induced drug refractoriness was overcome via a genetic deletion of P2X7R and via treatment with P2X7R antagonists [100], suggesting P2X7R-based treatments as adjunctive treatment for drug-refractory status epilepticus and, possibly, drug-refractory epilepsy. Notably, further suggesting the potential of P2X7R antagonists as adjunctive treatment for pharmaco-resistant status epilepticus, previous studies have shown that P2X7R antagonists, when given in combination with lorazepam at a timepoint during intra-amygdala KA-induced status epilepticus when sensitivity to lorazepam was reduced, efficiently stopped seizures [83]. Likewise, P2X7R antagonists, when given in combination with carbamazepine, increased the seizure threshold in the maximal electroshock test [108].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nThe molecular pathways of how P2X7R signalling impacts on seizures and epilepsy remain to be established. While P2X7R driving inflammatory processes is the most likely explanation [116], it is important to keep in mind that P2X7R signalling has been involved in numerous pathways in the brain, with several of these having a known role during epileptogenesis (e.g., maintenance of the BBB, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, control of neurotransmitter release, et cetera) [71,72,73,74,75,117]. Evidence supporting P2X7R contributing to brain hyperexcitability via driving inflammation include that (i) P2X7Rs are highly expressed on microglia, which increases following status epilepticus and increases during epilepsy [87,100], (ii) blocking of P2X7Rs during status epilepticus reduced hippocampal IL-1β levels [83] (iii) and the fact that while microglia from P2X7R-overexpressing mice showed a pro-inflammatory phenotype during status epilepticus [100], microglia from P2X7R KO mice presented an anti-inflammatory phenotype following hypoxia-induced seizures in neonatal mouse pups [98]. In addition, treatment of mice with an anti-inflammatory agent (i.e., minocycline) abolishes P2X7R-mediated effects during seizures [98,100]. If pro-convulsant effects of P2X7Rs are mediated via driving inflammation, this may also partly explain differences in P2X7R-based treatment responses observed between different models and disease stages. In this scenario, for P2X7R antagonists to reduce brain hyperexcitability, this would require underlying inflammation, which may differ between models (e.g., status epilepticus vs. acute non-damaging seizures; acute pathology vs. ongoing pathology during epilepsy). Other possible explanations include substrate availability. P2X7Rs require elevated extracellular ATP concentrations [118], potentially only available under more severe conditions (e.g., status epilepticus) or ongoing pathology (i.e., epilepsy). Cell-type-specific responses according to the model used may further contribute to the observed differences. While highly expressed on microglia following seizures and during epilepsy, P2X7Rs have also been reported to be increased on oligodendrocytes and neurons [81,85,87]. Whether expression changes in these cell types contribute to the epileptic phenotype remains, however, to be shown. Therefore, much more research is needed to identify the exact pathways of how P2X7Rs contribute to epilepsy via, for example, the use of cell-type-specific P2X7R KO mice in microglia or neurons.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.3. The P2X7R as Mechanistic Biomarker for Seizures and Epilepsy\\n\\nThe capacity to identify patients who are in need of and can benefit most from treatments (personalized medicine) is an important ability to improve the efficiency of pharmacological approaches. This is even more important in the treatment of diseases as heterogeneous as epilepsies, where patients are likely to show different responses according to the underlying aetiology and pathology. Moreover, mechanistic biomarkers, with a known role during disease pathogenesis, are much more informative and more accurately reflect the disease state compared to descriptive biomarkers, which result as a side product of the disease. As outlined before, P2X7R expression has been shown to be altered in brain tissue during epilepsy (mice and humans) [57]. In addition, P2X7R expression is not restricted to the brain and P2X7Rs are highly expressed on different circulating immune cells, where they contribute to the activation of the peripheral immune system and the release of inflammatory molecules, such as the known P2X7R downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, into the circulation [119,120]. Of note, several P2X7R-dependent inflammation markers have been shown to be dysregulated in the blood of epilepsy patients (e.g., IL-1β [121,122], IL-18 [123]), potentially serving as useful surrogate makers of P2X7R activation/inhibition. Critically, diagnostic tools capable of detecting P2X7R protein and P2X7R downstream molecules are already available, including P2X7R-based positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands [124] and assays able to detect P2X7Rs in fluids such as blood (ELISA) [120] (Table 2).\\n\\n3.3.1. P2X7R-PET Imaging as Novel Diagnostic Tool for Epilepsy'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PET imaging is a well-established technique and routinely used for the diagnosis of brain diseases, including epilepsy [130]. To date, PET imaging in epilepsy is primarily used to image glucose metabolism via the radiotracers 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose or [18F]FDG [131]. However, over the past few years, radiotracers detecting other molecules have been developed with radiotracers recognizing inflammatory targets, such as the Translocator protein (TSPO), a suggested marker of activated glia [132,133], being of particular interest.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nSeveral P2X7R radiotracers have now been successfully developed and tested in experimental models of epilepsy and resected brain tissue from patients, including the P2X7R-specific radioligand [18F]JNJ-64413739 [134]. Using this radioligand, a recent study analysing human cortical tissue sections resected from a total of 48 drug-resistant epilepsy patients demonstrated specific binding of [18F]JNJ-64413739 in different brain structures, including grey and white matter [125]. When correlating P2X7R-PET radioligand uptake in tissue sections to clinical and demographic data from patients, the authors found, however, no significant correlation of P2X7R radiotracer uptake with age, sex and duration of epilepsy. It is, however, noteworthy to mention that P2X7R radioligand uptake was not correlated to other clinical data, such as underlying pathology (e.g., presence or absence of hippocampal sclerosis) or disease severity and seizure frequency. Of note, P2X7R-radiotracer uptake showed an almost inverse correlation to the widely used surrogate marker of glial density, TSPO, measured via [123I]CLINDE, suggesting that either both proteins are expressed in different cell types and/or that their regulation differs according to disease stage. In a second recent study, Fu et al. investigated P2X7R radiotracer dynamics via PET/computerized tomography (CT) longitudinal imaging using the P2X7R-PET ligand 18F-FTTM in a rat model, where status epilepticus was induced via an intracranial injection of KA into the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus [127]. P2X7R-PET imaging was carried out at three different disease stages: (i) acute (1–2 days post-KA injection), (ii) latent period (7–10 days post-KA) and (iii) established epilepsy (3 months post-KA). Increased P2X7R radiotracer uptake was evident immediately post-status epilepticus and peaked during the latent period returning to baseline control levels during epilepsy. This included several brain structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and temporal cortex. The authors further concluded that this increase was mostly related to microglia, suggesting that changes in P2X7R-PET ligand uptake may serve as a readout of altered brain inflammation during epilepsy [127].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nFurther exploring the diagnostic potential of P2X7R-PET imaging for epilepsy, we recently published a study using the P2X7R radiotracer [18F]JNJ-64413739 [126]. Here, P2X7R radiotracer uptake was measured 48 h post-intra-amygdala KA-induced status epilepticus in mice, a timepoint that represents the seizure-free latent period in this model [135]. While P2X7R radiotracer uptake was not increased when comparing mice subjected to status epilepticus with control, we found a strong correlation between P2X7R radiotracer uptake and the severity of status epilepticus, with mice undergoing a more severe status epilepticus showing higher P2X7R radioligand brain levels when compared to mice with a milder status epilepticus and control. Of note, P2X7R radiotracer uptake was evident throughout the brain, including both ipsi- and contralateral brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, cortex, amygdala and thalamus), similar to findings from Fu et al. [127] and to our results using P2X7R-EGFP reporter mice [87]. While the diffuse P2X7R expression throughout the brain most likely means that P2X7R-based PET imaging is not a good tool to identify the epileptic focus, the fact that P2X7R radioligand uptake correlated with the severity of status epilepticus suggests that P2X7R-PET may have potential as a predictive biomarker supporting the stratification of patients according to disease progression and underlying pathology. Noteworthily, increased P2X7R expression has been shown to reduce the responsiveness to current ASMs [100]. Measuring P2X7R radioligand uptake may, therefore, not only help to identify patients possibly benefitting from P2X7R-based treatments but also to identify patients at risk of drug refractoriness. Of note, we observed a similar correlation between P2X7R radiotracer uptake and seizure severity during status epilepticus in several organs. This was most evident in the liver, heart and lungs. Epilepsy is characterized by increased systemic inflammation [136] and comorbidities that involve peripheral organs such as the heart [137]. Future studies should be designed to establish whether P2X7Rs contribute to epilepsy-induced organ damage and whether this can be prevented/mitigated via drugs targeting this receptor. Finally, in the same study, we found increased P2X7R radiotracer uptake in resected tissue sections from epilepsy patients when compared to control, further confirming the diagnostic potential of P2X7R-based PET. Whether P2X7R-PET has the potential to stratify patients beyond epilepsy diagnosis (i.e., underlying pathology, epilepsy syndrome, disease severity) will, however, require the analysis of much larger patient cohorts.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In summary, while still at an early stage and more detailed studies in animal models and in larger epilepsy patient cohorts are required, P2X7R-based PET imaging may represent a promising tool to support the diagnosis of patients at risk of/with epilepsy and to identify patients who would benefit from P2X7R-based treatments.\\n\\n3.3.2. P2X7R Signalling Components as Diagnostic Tools for Seizures and Epilepsy\\n\\nP2X7R expression is not restricted to brain tissue, and P2X7Rs can be found throughout the body, including the peripheral immune system (e.g., macrophages, T cells) [119,138,139]. Suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker, a recent study by Giuliani et al. showed that P2X7Rs can be shed into circulation, which seems to be increased under inflammatory conditions. The same study identified monocytes as the most likely source of P2X7Rs [120]. Subsequent studies have shown increased P2X7R in blood cells of patients with diabetes [140] and myasthenia gravis [141]. P2X7R protein levels were also increased in the plasma of patients with sepsis and COVID-19 [142,143].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nTo test whether P2X7R expression changes in the blood of patients with epilepsy, in a recent study, we analysed plasma from TLE patients (n = 30) via ELISA and compared these to plasma samples from patients suffering from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (n = 11), patients who underwent a recent episode of status epilepticus (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 34) [128]. PNES patients show similar behaviour changes resembling an epileptic seizure, but without the characteristic alterations on the EEG associated with epileptic seizures, and are a particularly valuable control group, as most are on a similar treatment regimen as patients with epilepsy [144]. Plasma samples were analysed during baseline (i.e., following an at least 24 h seizure-free period) and 1 h after a recent seizure. This revealed increased P2X7R plasma concentrations in patients with TLE and in patients with status epilepticus when compared to control and patients with PNES. No further increases to baseline levels were observed 1 h following seizures, suggesting that increased P2X7R plasma levels are due to the underlying pathology rather than being a direct result of seizures. While differences in P2X7R plasma concentrations between TLE patients and control were only moderate (sensitivity (60%) and specificity (74%)), ROC analysis between TLE patients and patients with PNES showed a high sensitivity (90%) and good specificity (63%). Of note, in contrast to previous studies [145], no significant difference between groups was found when analysing the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CPR). In order to identify what blood cells overexpress P2X7R following seizures, EGFP-P2X7R reporter mice were subjected to intra-amygdala KA-induced status epilepticus and EGFP-positive blood cells quantified via FACS. This showed increased EGFP signal in blood post-status epilepticus and identified white blood cells as the most likely cell type to overexpress P2X7Rs, similar to what had been shown in humans [120]. To identify P2X7R downstream signalling in blood and, thereby, possible markers of P2X7R over-activation, blood samples were analysed via cytokine arrays from wild-type and P2X7R knock-out mice subjected to intra-amygdala KA-induced status epilepticus. This identified the cytokine keratinocyte chemoattractant/human-growth-regulated oncogene (KC/GRO) as a potential P2X7R-dependent plasma biomarker following status epilepticus and during epilepsy [128].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Genetic alterations (e.g., de novo mutations, genetic polymorphism) are increasingly recognized to contribute to epilepsy and even to unresponsiveness to ASMs [146]. The human P2rx7 gene has been described to be highly polymorphic, with several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to change the receptor function into either loss- or gain-of-function variants [62,63]. While mainly associated to other brain diseases, such as major depression, mood disorders and sleep disorders [58,147,148], a study published by Emsley et al. in 2014 suggests the gain-of-function missense SNP rs208294 in P2rx7 to be involved in susceptibility to childhood-onset febrile seizures [129]. Whether P2X7R SNPs are a risk for epilepsy development, unresponsiveness to ASMs or disease severity has, to my knowledge, not been published yet.\\n\\nFinally, while not directly related to P2X7R signalling, but nevertheless demonstrating the diagnostic potential of the purinergic signalling system for epilepsy, blood purines measured via summated electrochemical detection of adenosine and adenosine breakdown products inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine were elevated after status epilepticus in mice and in TLE patients (baseline levels) [149]. Blood purine levels in mice correlated with seizure severity during status epilepticus and seizure-induced neurodegeneration, suggesting blood purines as a possible tool supporting patient stratification according to underlying pathology. Interestingly, we also showed blood purines to be increased in mouse pups after hypoxia-induced seizures and infants with neonatal encephalopathy and seizures [150]. Whether P2X7R contributes to changes in blood purines during seizures and epilepsy remains to be determined. ATP can, however, also be released via P2X7Rs [39] and, once released, is rapidly broken down into different breakdown products including adenosine [151].\\n\\n4. Conclusions'),\n",

Postzygotic variants in KRAS have been described in oculoectodermal syndrome (OES), encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) and epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS). This study confirms the continuum of mosaic neurocutaneous RASopathies showing codon 146 KRAS variants in an individual with OES and, for the first time, in an individual with (isolated) epidermal nevus. The presence of a nevus psiloliparus in individuals with OES indicates that this finding is not specific for ECCL and highlights the phenotypical overlap between ECCL and OES. The presence of the somatic KRAS variant in the nevus psiloliparus resolves the underlying molecular etiology of this fatty-tissue nevus. In addition, this finding refutes the theory of non-allelic twin-spotting as an underlying hypothesis to explain the concurrent presence of two different mosaicisms in one individual. The identification of codon 146 KRAS variants in isolated epidermal nevus introduces a new hot spot for this condition, which is useful for increasing molecular genetic testing using targeted gene sequencing panels.\\n\\nepidermal nevus\\noculoectodermal syndrome\\nencephalocraniocutaneous syndrome\\nnevus psiloliparus\\nepibulbar dermoid\\nKRAS\\nRASopathy\\nnon-allelic twin spotting\\ndidymosis'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nThe RASopathies comprise a group of developmental disorders caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding the RAS/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, including neurofibromatosis type 1, Legius-, Noonan-, cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC)- and Costello syndrome [1]. Mosaic RASopathies, caused by post-zygotic variants in components of the RAS pathway, are an expanding group of (neuro)cutaneous disorders with high phenotypic variability, including for example oculoectodermal syndrome (OES), encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) and epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) [1]. The timing and location of these somatic variants during development determine the extent and distribution of the affected organs. OES is a rare disorder characterized by the consistent combination of congenital scalp lesions and epibulbar dermoids. Aplasia congenita cutis (ACC) is the most common skin finding in OES, characterised by hairless, atrophic and non-scarring regions with asymmetrical distribution [2]. Hamartomas can be associated with the areas of ACC. Other ectodermal findings include linear hyperpigmentation following the lines of Blaschko and, more rarely, epidermal nevus-like lesions. Ocular abnormalities consist of uni- or bilateral epibulbar dermoids, skin tags on the eyelid, and rarely, optic nerve or retinal changes. The phenotype of OES is highly variable and additional features may include growth retardation, cardiovascular manifestations (aortic coarctation, atrial or septal ventricular defects, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and mild neurodevelopmental problems (neurodevelopmental delay, learning difficulties and behavioural problems) [3,4]. Patients are predisposed to develop age-dependent benign tumour-like lesions, such as non-ossifying fibromas of the long bones and giant cell granulomas of the jaws [5]. OES shows considerable phenotypic overlap with encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL), sharing symptoms such as focal alopecia, epibulbar dermoids, linear hyperpigmentation, cardiovascular manifestations and the predisposition to develop benign skeletal tumours [3,5,6]. However, ECCL usually involves the central nervous system, characterised by structural anomalies of the brain and spine, epilepsy, and more pronounced neurodevelopmental delay. So far, the presence of nevus psiloliparus, a smooth fatty tissue nevus with non-scarring alopecia, has been considered pathognomonic for ECCL. Exome sequencing of affected tissue identified somatic mosaicism for KRAS variants as a common genetic etiology for OES and ECCL [3,5].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Another heterogeneous group of disorders that belongs to the group of mosaic RASopathies includes epidermal nevi (EN) and their associated syndromes, such as linear nevus sebaceous (NS) syndrome (synonym: Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome), phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica and cutaneous-skeletal-hypophosphatasia (CSHS) syndrome. Isolated EN can be subdivided into non-organoid keratinocytic nevi (KEN) or organoid nevi (including NS and nevus comedonicus (NC), according to their predominantly keratinocytic or adnexal differentiation, respectively [7,8]. Isolated NS, KEN and linear NS syndrome are mostly associated with pathogenic variants in HRAS, and to a lesser extent with somatic KRAS variants [9]. Considering the observed overlap in underlying genotype, body-site specific determinants through distinct epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are thought to contribute to phenotypic diversity [10]. In this study, we confirm the continuum of mosaic (neuro)cutaneous RASopathies as we report on codon 146 KRAS variants in an individual with OES and nevus psiloliparus and, for the first time, in an individual with isolated EN.\\n\\n2.

       " Document(page_content='The first patient was a 5-year-old boy referred to our clinic because of the presence of ocular abnormalities, Blaschkoid hyperpigmentation and focal alopecia. He was the only child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents of Romanian descent. He presented with segmental areas of hyperpigmentation following a Blaschkoid distribution on the right upper half of the body and extending to his right arm. The lesions were slightly palpable on his neck. Similar abnormalities on the posterior part of the neck displayed a more yellowish-orange colour. The scalp showed three areas with yellow skin colour, diminished hair density and fair, almost white hairs. Despite the lack of palpable lesions, these skin abnormalities were suggestive of a linear epidermal and sebaceous nevus, respectively (Figure 1A–C). ACC was not present. Ocular abnormalities included a congenital coloboma of the right eyelid and an epibulbar dermoid involving both eyes, for which surgical correction was performed. Additional inspection revealed multinodular tissue that extended to the corneal limbus and covered parts of the visual axis. There was increased fat accumulation in the right upper eyelid (Figure 1A). Strabismus with amblyopia of the left eye was present because of high astigmatism. The patient’s vision improved following correction of the astigmatism with glasses and occlusion therapy.\\n\\nAdditional investigations consisted of a normal cardiac echocardiography, an electrocardiogram, an audiometry screening and a skeletal survey of the hips and lumbar spine. No structural intracranial abnormalities were identified on the brain MRI. His neurocognitive development was normal and he had no other health problems.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The second patient, a 3-year-old boy, was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy to non-consanguineous parents. The mother had high myopia with a risk for retinal detachment and some Marfanoid features, but had a normal FBN1 sequencing. The couple’s first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks gestational age. A maternal uncle showed isolated delayed language development, which normalised later in life. In addition, a maternal great aunt presented with mild intellectual disability and worked in a sheltered workshop. The proband presented at birth with a palpable verrucous hyperpigmented lesion following Blaschko lines on the chin and extending to the neck, suggestive of epidermal nevus. The EN showed a discrete elevated surface, but no papules (Figure 1D,E). Upon clinical examination, a hypopigmented macula was observed in the right inguinal area, as well as some linear hyperpigmentation in the knee fold. A small café-au-lait macula was located on the back of the right calf. A further inspection of skin, mucosa, hair and nails was normal, and there was no evidence of ACC or other scalp hamartomas. The patient’s early motor development was borderline with sitting and walking independently at the ages of 8 and 18 months, respectively. However, his active language development was delayed with his first words spoken at the age of 2. His passive language skills were normal. A re-evaluation at the age of 3 years and 9 months showed normal active language skills, normal behaviour and an average IQ. A brain MRI and an ophthalmological evaluation using a slit-lamp examination and a fundoscopy were normal.\\n\\n2.2. Histological Findings'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Two different skin lesions were biopsied in individual 1: the linear hyperpigmentation on the right arm, suspicious for linear EN, and the area of focal alopecia on the scalp, suspicious for NS. In the first lesion, discrete acanthosis, hyperkeratosis and pigmentation of the basal layer were observed, which indeed are suggestive of the diagnosis of KEN (Figure 2A). In the second lesion, no typical characteristics of NS were withheld. However, the presence of fat in the dermis, tissue fibrosis and an anagen arrest of hair follicles was found, matching the diagnosis of nevus psiloliparus (Figure 2C,D).\\n\\nIn individual 2, a skin biopsy from the lesion in the neck showed papillomatosis with accompanying seborrheic epithelial hyperplasia and the presence of two inclusion cysts, suggestive of the diagnosis of EN (Figure 2B).\\n\\n2.3. Molecular Genetic Testing\\n\\nMolecular genetic testing in proband 1 comprised molecular karyotyping on DNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes, which showed a paternally inherited 620 kb duplication on the Y chromosome and was classified as benign. Subsequent next-generation sequencing analysis on DNA directly extracted from a skin biopsy taken in the linear hyperpigmentation was able to identify a mosaic missense variant (c.436G > A, p.(Ala146Thr)) in the KRAS gene, illustrated by variant frequencies of 60% in cells of the epidermis and 22% in the dermis/hypodermis. This confirms the diagnosis of oculoectodermal syndrome (Figure 3). Additionally, DNA extracted from the nevus psiloliparus was analysed and confirmed the presence of the same KRAS (c.436G > A, p.(Ala146Thr)) variants, with a frequency of 54% in the epidermis and 5% in the dermis/hypodermis (Figure 3).'),\n",

Molecular karyotyping on DNA from peripheral leukocytes identified a maternally inherited 140 kb duplication in chromosome band Xp11.22. This duplication includes the two first exons of the HUWE1 gene, containing the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). HUWE1 is associated with X-linked neurodevelopmental and intellectual disability [11]. The variant did not segregate from the neurodevelopmental phenotype in the family and was considered a class 3 variant.\\n\\n3. Discussion'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nMosaic RASopathies are an expanding group of pleiotropic disorders caused by postzygotic, activating variants in highly conserved RAS oncogenes and other associated genes of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Variants leading to over-activation of RAS-MAPK signalling are similar to the somatic driver variants observed in these proto-oncogenes during tumorigenesis [12]. As these oncogenic variants are not tolerated in the germline and most often result in embryonal lethality, RASopathy disorders tend to be caused by hypomorphic variants associated with less over-activation of the pathway [13]. There are a few exemptions to this rule, with reported germline oncogenic changes in HRAS in Costello syndrome, in KRAS in CFC syndrome, and in PTPN11 in Noonan syndrome [14,15,16]. Codon 146 oncogenic KRAS variants have been identified as a common genetic etiology in OES and ECCL, whereas codon 13 and 19 only have been associated with OES [3,5]. Correspondingly, both disorders demonstrate considerable phenotypic overlap, sharing focal alopecia, epibulbar dermoids, linear hyperpigmentation, and a predisposition to develop benign skeletal tumours. Differentiation between the two entities can be challenging but is important due to differences in prognosis and management. ECCL is considered the severest form within the spectrum, characterised by structural brain abnormalities, seizures and intellectual disability [17]. This study confirms the continuum of mosaic neurocutaneous RASopathies due to codon 146 KRAS variants. Both reported individuals present with slightly palpable linear hyperpigmentation following Blaschko lines, histopathologically confirmed as KEN. Individual 1 further presented with focal alopecia, congenital coloboma and epibulbar dermoid in absence of any neurological manifestations, suggestive of OES. Interestingly, focal areas of alopecia are suggestive of nevus psiloliparus, rather than aplasia cutis. Nevus psiloliparus, a smooth, hairless fatty tissue nevus on the scalp, has been considered as a pathognomonic hallmark of ECCL, but has also been described in one case of OES and two non-syndromic cases [3,18,19]. As such, this observation further supports the phenotypical overlap between both disorders and indicates that nevus psiloliparus is not solely specific for ECCL.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In individual 2, KEN occurred as an isolated feature. Activated RAS variants can be identified in isolated KEN in 39% of cases, with almost 90% due to hotspot variants in HRAS. Despite having been described more frequently in isolated nevus sebaceous and Schimmelpenning syndrome, a sole case of isolated KEN attributed to somatic KRAS variants has been reported until now. In both isolated and syndromic forms, the KRAS hotspot is located at codon 12 [9,10]. Here, we describe the first case of isolated KEN due to postzygotic codon 146 KRAS variants. Since molecular testing for epidermal nevi and their associated syndromes is often restricted to targeted gene analysis of hot spots, we recommend full gene coverage in case hotspot analysis reveals no pathogenic variants. In addition, adequate tissue sampling and processing is of utmost importance to increase the diagnostic yield. Because of the presence of a class 3 HUWE1 variant, it remains speculative if the mosaic KRAS variant is (partly) contributing to an initial delay in language delay development [11]. Nevertheless, the proband’s neuromotor development was able to catch up well.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Historically, the theory of non-allelic twin spotting or didymosis has been put forward to explain the concurrent presence of two different mosaicisms in one individual, as for example in OES with didymosis aplasticopsilolipara (coexistence of aplasia cutis and nevus psiloliparus) or in phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica (PPK) with didymosis spilosebaceus (coexistence of sebaceous nevus and nevus spilus) [20,21]. The hypothesis stated that the occurrence of a recombinational somatic event, by which two non-allelic recessive variants homozygously concur in neighbouring cells, gives rise to the existence of the two observed phenotypes [21,22]. However, the theory has been refuted in PPK by the identification of postzygotic variants in HRAS [23,24]. In this report, individual 1 presents with coexistent epidermal nevus and nevus psiloliparus. We identified postzygotic KRAS variants in both lesions, which again counters the theory of twin spotting in OES and other mosaic disorders. In addition, this resolves the underlying molecular etiology of nevus psiloliparus, which was hereto unknown.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The pleiotropic and variable phenotype of mosaic KRAS variants is primarily related to the timing during development, which determines the extent and distribution of manifestations. As such, body site is thought to be an important element of observed features, reflected by NS occurring mostly on the head and neck, and KEN occurring on other body sites [10,25]. In addition, genotype-determined functional consequences may influence tissue-specific cell fate decision and hence, observed tissue-specific manifestations [3]. RAS functions as a molecular switch between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. The conversion is mediated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS [26]. Impairment of this hydrolytic reaction and constitutional RAS activation is the most common biochemical alteration observed in oncogenic RAS variants, which includes codon 12. Contrarily, codon 13 and 146 variants increase nucleotide exchange kinetics due to specific spatial relationships to the RAS nucleotide binding cleft in the absence of increased GTPase activity [27,28]. These functional differences could result in divergent phenotypic manifestations. However, the identification of codon 146 KRAS variants in KEN contradicts this hypothesis and suggests that other molecular mechanisms, in addition to the temporospatial distribution of the postzygotic variant, contribute to variability in the clinical spectrum of mosaic RASopathies. Finally, the risk of malignancy in OES/ECCL has been attributed to the presence of oncogenic KRAS variants, including giant cell tumours and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, which should justify regular clinical follow-up [29,30,31]. Whether this risk for malignancy is also applicable in isolated lesions remains a matter of debate due to the limited number of reported cases.'),\n",

Next-generation sequencing analysis on DNA directly extracted from the epidermal and dermal/hypodermal fraction was performed using a tumour hotspot gene panel (Tumor Hotspot MASTR Plus, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), including AKT1, ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, FGFR3, H3F3A, HIST1H3B, HRAS, IDH1, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PK3R1, PTEN, and STK11. Molecular analysis was conducted at gDNA level using multiplex PCR amplification. The obtained library preps were analysed following the Illumina sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technology (Miseq, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), with minimal expected coverage depth of 500×. Obtained sequence profiles were aligned to the respective reference sequences using the SeqNext software version 5.2.0 (JSI Medical Systems GmbH, Ettenheim, Germany).

Mutations in the gene encoding TNAP leading to severe hypophosphatasia result in strongly reduced mineralization and perinatal death. Fortunately, the relatively recent development of a recombinant TNAP with a bone anchor has allowed to correct the bone defects and prolong the life of affected babies and children. Researches on TNAP must however not be slowed down, because accumulating evidence indicates that TNAP activation in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with enhanced cardiovascular mortality, presumably in relation with cardiovascular calcification. On the other hand, TNAP appears to be necessary to prevent the development of steatohepatitis in mice, suggesting that TNAP plays protective roles. The aim of the present review is to highlight the known or suspected functions of TNAP in energy metabolism that may be associated with the development of MetS. The location of TNAP in liver and its function in bile excretion, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detoxification and fatty acid transport will be presented. The expression and function of TNAP in adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis will also be discussed. Given that TNAP is a tissue- and substrate-nonspecific phosphatase, we believe that it exerts several crucial pathophysiological functions that are just beginning to be discovered.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nTissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is together with intestinal AP (IAP) the only AP that is expressed in humans after birth (reviewed in [1]). With few exceptions detailed below, it is moreover the only AP that has its active site inside the body, since IAP is active in the intestinal lumen and only occasionally found in the blood (discussed below). As its name indicates, TNAP is expressed in multiple tissues such as bone, growth plate cartilage, tooth, liver, kidney or brain [1]. In most cell types, it is attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In some cells and in different circumstances, TNAP can be released extracellularly, either attached to the membrane of extracellular vesicles, or as a soluble enzyme after the cleavage of the GPI anchor. While circulating TNAP mainly originates from bones during skeletal growth, it comes from both bones and the liver in adults [2]. In adulthood, strong increases in serum TNAP activity often reflect cholestasis, either intrahepatic or extrahepatic, or biliary obstruction due to cancer [3]. More modest elevations occur in the context of hepatitis, and more generally in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS), in whom serum TNAP levels predict cardiovascular mortality [4,5,6,7,8,9]. Since the main function of TNAP in humans is to drive tissue mineralization [by dephosphorylating the mineralization inhibitor inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)], it is suspected that the association between TNAP levels and cardiovascular mortality relies on the exacerbation of atherosclerosis plaque calcification [10]. The hypothesis that TNAP activation in patients with MetS worsens the cardiovascular risk by increasing vascular calcification has been recently reviewed [11] and is not the subject of the present article. Instead, we review here published data providing evidence to better understand why TNAP levels are increased in adults with MetS. Since the liver is the main source of circulating TNAP in MetS, and TNAP is expressed by hepatocytes and cholangiocytes [12,13], we will first explore the pathophysiological function of TNAP in the liver, the bile and the intestinal lumen. Then, we will move to recent articles suggesting unanticipated functions of TNAP in adipocytes.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2. TNAP’s Pathophysiological Functions in the Liver, Bile and Intestinal Lumen\\n\\nThe group of Olga Martinez-Augustin, in this journal issue, reported that Alpl+/− mice develop liver steatosis when fed a high fat diet (HFD) [14]. This suggests that at least in mice, TNAP exerts metabolic functions. Whether this is also true in humans is unknown and difficult to investigate. Individuals with TNAP deficiency (hypophosphatasia, HPP) have not been reported to develop metabolic diseases [15,16]. This does not necessarily mean that TNAP deficiency has metabolic consequences in mice but not in humans. HPP is a rare disease, which makes virtually impossible to design clinical studies with a sufficient number of HPP patients. Moreover, children with severe HPP, who, a decade ago died in early life from bone hypomineralization, are now increasingly treated with recombinant asfotase alfa [17]. This recombinant TNAP is designed to attach to bone, but it is present in high levels in the circulation in treated children, where it likely exerts most of the extraosseous functions of TNAP and prevents the development of metabolic diseases. In this chapter, we will nevertheless present several studies performed with cultured human cells, which suggest that in humans like in mice, TNAP has metabolic functions.\\n\\n2.1. Localization of TNAP in the Liver\\n\\nThe liver localization of TNAP suggests two different functions (Figure 1). First, in mouse liver TNAP is localized at hepatocyte and cholangiocyte membranes facing bile canaliculi and ducts, with some differences between mouse strains [12,13]. In cultured rat hepatocytes, TNAP activity is also seen at the bile canalicular-like membrane [18,19]. This suggests a role for TNAP in bile excretion (discussed in Section 2.2). Second, TNAP is also expressed in endothelial cells of hepatic arteries in the portal triad [13]. This suggests a role for TNAP in the transport of molecules from the blood to the liver (discussed in Section 2.4).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.2. Function of TNAP in Bile Excretion\\n\\nAn important function of hepatocytes is to produce the bile, which consists of bile acids, the end-products of cholesterol metabolism, cholesterol itself, phosphatidylcholine and toxic metabolites [20]. It is highly conceivable that liver TNAP plays a role in bile excretion [3]. As mentioned above, TNAP is active at the hepatocyte and cholangiocyte membranes facing bile canaliculi and ducts [12]. Moreover, cholestasis is clinically associated with increased serum TNAP activity, in part due to the retrograde reflux of biliary TNAP [21], and in part to the de novo expression of liver TNAP [22]. TNAP expression in cholangiocytes is indeed increased after bile duct ligation [21], and in cultured rat hepatocytes, bile acids dose-dependently increase TNAP activity [23]. Furthermore, in cultured human HepG2 hepatocytes, taurine-conjugated cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid time- and dose-dependently increase TNAP activity [24].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nThe most likely function of TNAP in bile excretion is to participate in the regulation of bile pH and of bile excretion during the postprandial period (reviewed in [3,25,26]). Cholangiocytes are exposed to millimolar concentrations of extracellular bile salts. Glycine and taurine conjugates of bile salts have a pKa of approximately 4 and 1–2 respectively, and therefore, at these high concentrations, a significant amount of bile acids might be protonated and toxic [25]. The increase in bile pH from 7.3 during fasting to 7.5 after meal ingestion that accompanies bile secretion is therefore likely necessary to protect cholangiocytes [25]. How bile pH is regulated in association with bile excretion is relatively well understood (Figure 2). Exposed to bile flow [27], hepatocytes and cholangiocytes release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the bile to activate purinergic P2Y receptors and enhance Cl− secretion through cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The rise of extracellular Cl− then stimulates the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger AE2 (anion exchanger 2) to allow carbonate secretion and increase the pH [3,25,28]. The hormone secretin also stimulates ductal choleresis by activating CFTR and subsequently AE2. Activated by the rise in pH, TNAP may then dephosphorylate ATP to reduce P2Y receptor activation, allowing the pH to reach back initial values (Figure 2). This hypothetical contribution of TNAP to pH regulation during choleresis was experimentally strengthened by Alvaro et al., who showed that AP administration in rats slowed down bicarbonate secretion and bile flow that were stimulated by secretin [21]. They moreover showed that TNAP inhibition with levamisole logically induced a significant increase in basal bile flow [21]. Interestingly, such a function of TNAP in the regulation of the gastrointestinal pH has already been described for intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Indeed, IAP is believed to regulate the intestinal pH and protect the mucosa against acidic injuries by dephosphorylating ATP [29]. In summary, TNAP may play a role in the regulation of bile excretion, and consequently of lipid digestion. Whether this role accounts for the liver steatosis in Alpl+/− mice fed a high fat diet is unknown but deserves consideration [14].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.3. Function of TNAP in the Bile and the Intestinal Lumen\\n\\nThe function of liver TNAP may not be restricted to bile excretion but might extend to intestinal digestion and absorption of lipids and/or bacterial compounds. A fraction of liver TNAP is indeed excreted in the intestinal lumen within the bile. TNAP is released with fragments of hepatocytes and/or cholangiocytes upon the action of bile acids [30]. In addition to liver TNAP, bone TNAP is also excreted in the bile after its release from bones into the blood. At the hepatocyte membrane, circulating TNAP binds to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which recognizes galactose-terminated glycoproteins, and is transcytosed toward the bile [21,31]. Bone and liver TNAP seem to be excreted in the bile at different rates due to their different glycosylation pattern. While both isoforms are N-glycosylated, which seems important for their catalytic activity, bone, but not liver TNAP, is O-glycosylated [32,33]. Moreover, the liver isoform is more sialylated than the bone one, and is eliminated more slowly [31]. Therefore, some liver and bone TNAP activity is constantly released from inside the body to the intestinal lumen with bile excretion. The function of TNAP in the intestinal lumen is unknown. Since TNAP and IAP share a similar enzymatic activity (reviewed in [1]), it can be hypothesized that TNAP helps IAP accomplish its tasks.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nIAP at least exerts two suspected important functions. First, IAP dephosphorylates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the intestinal track [34,35], to limit the postprandial endotoxemia that is inevitably associated with lipid absorption [36]. The 1′- and 4′-lipid A phosphates of LPS are considered critical for its pro-inflammatory effects as dephosphorylated lipid A congeners weakly stimulate toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 [37]. Accordingly, APs are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects by dephosphorylating LPS and reducing TLR4 activation [38,39]. LPS dephosphorylation by IAP in the intestinal lumen is required to prevent intestinal, liver and systemic inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and early death [34,35]. IAP activity nevertheless decreases with recurrent episodes of infection, resulting in the progressive disability of the intestine to fight new infections [40]. The decline of IAP is associated with increased intestinal neuraminidase desialylation of IAP and increased IAP degradation, which in turns favors LPS activation of intestinal TLR4 [40]. Importantly, long-term oral supplementation with IAP in aged mice prolonged life expectancy with reduced systemic inflammation, liver damage, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, reduced low density lipoprotein (LDL)-associated cholesterol (c-LDL), increased high density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated cholesterol (c-HDL), and reduced glycemia [35]. These beneficial effects likely relied on reduced LPS activation of TLR4 since they were attenuated in Tlr4-deficient mice [41]. In addition, in experimental liver disease induced by bile duct ligation or CCl4 exposure, oral IAP administration attenuated the compromised intestinal barrier permeability and liver fibrosis, in association with reduced LPS absorption [42]. Furthermore, intestine-specific overexpression of a chimeric alkaline phosphatase attenuated the metabolic syndrome induced by a western diet [43]. A second important function proposed for IAP is dephosphorylation of CD36 and modulation of fatty acid (FA) uptake [44,45]. CD36, which was first identified as a cellular receptor for thrombospondin and a protein involved in platelet aggregation, was subsequently discovered as a receptor for oxidized LDL and a facilitator of FA transport (reviewed in [46]). CD36 has two transmembrane domains and two consensus phosphorylation sites in its extracellular loop, at Thr92 and Ser237 (Figure 3, reviewed in [46]).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Thr92 is a consensus site for protein kinase C (PKC) and Ser237 for PKA [46]. In platelets, CD36 ectophosphorylation at Ser237 inhibits FA uptake, in a reversible manner after treatment with AP [48]. In intestinal cells, the transport activity of CD36 is also increased after treatment with IAP and decreased when IAP is inhibited [44]. Experimental data moreover exist to suggest that IAP and CD36 interact physically, which strengthens the hypothesis that IAP controls FA transport through CD36 phosphorylation status [45]. The fact that IAP-deficient mice have abnormal lipid transcytosis across enterocytes might account in the development of metabolic syndrome when these mice are fed a HFD [49]. Nevertheless, dephosphorylation of CD36 also increases thrombospondin binding [50], suggesting that AP dephosphorylation of CD36 might have other consequences than only modulating FA transport.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Whether TNAP that is eliminated in the duodenum within the bile exerts the same functions as IAP is unknown and remains purely speculative. On one hand, since mice deficient in Akp3, one of the two genes encoding IAP, have higher circulating TNAP levels than wildtype mice during aging [51], and since TNAP is eliminated in the intestine, it is tempting to speculate that this TNAP upregulation aims to compensate IAP deficiency. On the other hand, if TNAP and IAP have very similar enzymatic activities, TNAP is more effective in PPi hydrolysis as compared to LPS, while the reverse is true for IAP [52]. This suggests that IAP and TNAP do not exert totally redundant activities. In addition, the fact that IAP activity was detected in the kidney [53], where AP activity is generally considered to rely exclusively on TNAP, also suggests that both enzymes are not redundant. Finally, the hypothesis that IAP and TNAP have relatively specific activities is strengthened by the fat that in inflammatory conditions, intestinal cells express both IAP and TNAP [54]. In the latter study, inflammation not only increased TNAP activity, but also modified its glycolysation and sensitivity to inhibitors, again suggesting that all AP do not have the same activity. Therefore, whether in the intestinal lumen TNAP helps IAP accomplish its functions or whether it exerts any specific effect remains speculative.\\n\\n2.4. Functions of TNAP in Liver Metabolism'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nWhile the location of liver TNAP at the hepatocyte and cholangiocyte membranes facing bile canaliculi and ducts suggests a specific role in bile excretion and function, the presence of TNAP in endothelial cells of hepatic arteries in the portal triad suggests additional functions, likely associated with the dephosphorylation of circulating molecules [13]. Among these candidate molecules, it is highly conceivable that liver TNAP, together with the IAP that has been transferred from enterocytes to the blood after a fatty meal [55,56,57], contributes to dephosphorylate the absorbed LPS that has escaped from IAP in the intestinal lumen. Interestingly, circulating LPS is removed from the body into the bile, suggesting that liver TNAP is involved [58]. High endotoxemia is moreover associated with liver steatosis and fibrosis [59,60,61,62], as is TNAP deficiency [14]. The assumption that TNAP dephosphorylates and inactivates LPS in the blood is further strengthened by the report that the TNAP inhibitor levamisole increased the mortality of rats injected intraperitoneally with LPS [39]. In physiological conditions, endothelial TNAP is likely to account for the largest part of circulating LPS dephosphorylation, but in diseased livers, hepatocytes also likely participate. Indeed, while liver Kupffer cells appear to be the cells responsible for the removal of the largest part of LPS, hepatocytes seem also involved [58]. In rat liver sections, LPS was indeed efficiently dephosphorylated on hepatocyte and cholangiocyte membranes at locations where TNAP is normally active [63]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that TNAP activity is increased in hepatocytes during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development in association with an enhanced ability of fibrotic livers to dephosphorylate LPS [64]. We should also mention that TNAP in neutrophils might participate in postprandial LPS detoxification [65]. Neutrophils are recruited in the liver after a meal, in particular when it is enriched with fructose [66], and they accumulate in the liver of animals fed with high fat diets for several weeks [67]. High fat diets leading to the development of NASH are associated with metabolic endotoxemia [68], and chronic injections of low doses of LPS worsen inflammation and fibrosis during the development of experimental NASH [69]. Clinically, endotoxemia is also positively associated with NASH and liver fibrosis [60]. In this context, liver TNAP upregulation in NASH may be a mean to counteract LPS toxicity [64]. In summary, liver TNAP may contribute to reduce postprandial endotoxemia and postprandial inflammation, and its activation in NASH may be associated with the increased endotoxemia and inflammation featuring NASH. This function of TNAP may not be restricted to repeated copious high fat meals associated with absorption of large amounts of LPS [36]. Indeed, the group of Donath et al., reported that LPS-associated postprandial inflammation is necessary for optimal insulin secretion and regulation of postprandial hyperglycemia [70]. TNAP may thus help resolve this physiological and useful low-grade postprandial inflammation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Like in the intestinal lumen, another possible TNAP substrate in the liver is CD36. In HepG2 hepatocytes cultured in presence of high glucose or FA levels, TNAP expression increased in parallel with that of CD36 [71,72], and TNAP inhibition with levamisole or siRNA reduced triglyceride (TG) accumulation [71,73]. That TNAP controls CD36 activity in hepatocytes however remains to be demonstrated. Since CD36 dephosphorylation facilitates FA uptake [44,45,46], if TNAP was responsible for dephosphorylating CD36, then its deficiency should lead to decreased, and not increased liver steatosis [14]. In fact, whether the function of TNAP in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes [71,72] relies on CD36 modulation remains obscure, because TNAP was reported to be located at the surface of lipid droplets [71], and thus not where CD36 is expected to be active. Finally, it is conceivable that TNAP indeed participates in CD36-associated FA uptake, but on other tissues than the liver, nevertheless impacting liver steatosis. Indeed, CD36 appears to be responsible for a large part of FA uptake in heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, but not liver [74]. If TNAP deficiency in these tissues decreases in CD36-dependent FA uptake, and if liver uptake of FA does not significantly rely on CD36 [74], then TNAP deficiency may increase the amount of FA available for liver uptake through CD36-independent mechanisms. This speculative mechanism is supported by the fact that CD36-deficient mice have increased, and not decreased, liver TG [75,76]. In summary, the possibility that TNAP deficiency leads to steatosis in association with CD36 ectophosphorylation is uncertain but deserves consideration.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Finally, the fact that Alpl+/− mice develop an exacerbated steatosis as compared to Alpl+/+ mice when the steatosis is induced by a HFD, but not when the steatosis is induced by a choline deficient-diet [14] suggests a possible role in phosphocholine dephosphorylation. Phosphatidylcholine is necessary in the liver for the production of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and the excretion of bile, and choline deficient diets are commonly given to induce liver steatosis in rodents (reviewed in [77,78]). About 70% of liver phosphatidylcholine arise from the uptake of extracellular choline (Figure 4).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nPhosphatidylcholine from the diet or from circulating lipoproteins is converted to phosphocholine by several enzymes that are still incompletely identified [77,79]. Phosphocholine seems to be generated by the action of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (NPP) NPP6 and NPP7 [80,81,82]. NPP6 is expressed in the liver and its deficiency leads to liver steatosis in mice [82]. If TNAP dephosphorylates phosphocholine, or contributes to dephosphorylate it, and allows choline uptake in the liver through SLC44A1 and SLC44A2 choline transporters [83,84], this would provide an explanation as to why TNAP-deficient mice develop liver steatosis on a HFD diet but not on a choline-deficient diet [14]. The second mechanism generating phosphocholine in the liver, and accounting for approximately 30% of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, is the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) [77]. Pemt−/− mice fed a HFD develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) resulting from lack of sufficient phosphatidylcholine to export TG in VLDL [85,86], and cholestasis due to insufficient phosphatidylcholine for bile excretion [87]. How extracellular phosphoethanolamine (PEA) is generated and how it is dephosphorylated into ethanolamine is, to our knowledge, still obscure. However, the fact that individuals with TNAP deficiency accumulate PEA in blood and urine [88] strongly suggests that TNAP is involved in PEA dephosphorylation into ethanolamine, and perhaps in the subsequent ethanolamine uptake into liver cells through SLC44A1 and SLC44A2 transporters [84]. It should however be pointed out that TNAP may increase extracellular PEA levels by reducing the activity of the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme ethanolamine phosphate phospholyase, thereby increasing the intracellular levels of PEA and its extracellular export (reviewed in [89]). If nevertheless TNAP indeed participates in extracellular PEA dephosphorylation, then it would be involved in the two known pathways that generate phosphatidylcholine in the liver.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3. Pathophysiological TNAP’s Function in Adipocytes\\n\\nIt seems now accepted that adipose tissue expandability relies on both the hyperplasia of existing adipocytes and the formation of new adipocytes from mesenchymal progenitors (reviewed in [90]). These adipocytes comprise at least three cell populations. White adipocytes store FA within TGs, and release them in the circulation when the glycemia drops. Brown adipocytes use FA energy to generate heat in mitochondria thanks to their production of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Finally, a new population of adipocytes, named beige or “brite” adipocytes, have been shown to share features with brown adipocytes but reside within white fat depots [90]. Interestingly, several recent articles showed that TNAP may participate in both the commitment of mesenchymal progenitors into adipocytes, and in their function, particularly in brown and/or beige adipocytes.\\n\\n3.1. Function of TNAP in Adipocyte Differentiation'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nWhile historically, TNAP has been associated with the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mineralizing osteoblasts and chondrocytes, relatively recent data suggest that it is already functional in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and also involved in MSC commitment into other lineages, and in particular adipocytes (reviewed in [91]). Published data however report data difficult to reconcile, maybe relying on the different maturation stage of cells used in these studies. It was for instance shown that bone marrow stromal cells from Alpl−/− or Alpl+/− mice or from patients with hypophosphatasia generate more adipocytes than bone marrow stromal cells from corresponding controls [92,93,94], suggesting that TNAP prevents MSC commitment toward adipocytes. On the other hand, Esteve et al., reported that TNAP was particularly expressed in a subpopulation of beige adipocyte progenitors, where its chemical or molecular inhibition reduced the levels of markers associated with adipocyte differentiation (PPARγ2, ChREBP, UCP1, LPL), and decreased TG accumulation [95]. Similar findings were obtained in adipocyte cultures, with TNAP expression increasing with the differentiation of 3T3-L1 or primary adipocytes, and its inhibition with levamisole decreasing TG accumulation [73,96,97]. The substrates and mechanisms through which TNAP may impact adipogenesis are poorly known. Alpl+/− MSCs appear to have higher levels of extracellular ATP than Alpl+/+ MSCs, suggesting that TNAP might inhibit adipocyte differentiation through ATP dephosphorylation and decreased activation of purinergic receptors [93]. On the other hand, in adipocytes, like in hepatocytes [71], TNAP was localized in association with lipid droplets, suggesting that TNAP may control adipocyte functions intracellularly [96,97]. In contrast with these studies, another article reported that in mature 3T3-F442A adipocytes, inhibition of TNAP activity with levamisole decreased lipolysis [98]. When cells were stimulated to trigger lipolysis in these experiments, TNAP was relocated from the surface of lipid droplets to cytoplasmic regions close to them [98]. Despite these puzzling data, the fact that TNAP-positive adipocytes are more abundant in obese than non-obese women [95] merits to further explore the functions of TNAP in adipocytes.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.2. Function of TNAP in Thermogenesis\\n\\nRecently, TNAP in adipocytes was shown to participate in thermogenesis [99]. The most well-known mechanism contributing to heat generation is associated with the presence of UCP1 at the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipocytes. UCP1 generates heat by dissipating the energy proton gradient from the electron transport chain in mitochondrial respiration. Besides this function of UCP1 in brown adipocyte thermogenesis, additional UCP1-independent mechanisms generating heat have recently emerged, both in brown and beige adipocytes [100]. One of these mechanisms is the futile creatine cycle, characterized by the group of Spiegelman et al. [101]. This cycle is active in human fat and cultured brown and beige adipocytes and dissipates the energy of phosphocreatine by generating a Pi instead of an ATP [101] (Figure 5). The kinase responsible for phosphorylating creatine in adipocytes was shown to be creatine kinase (CK) B [102], and the phosphatase dephosphorylating phosphocreatine revealed to be TNAP [99]. Spiegelman et al., first observed that TNAP expression in adipocytes was increased after cold exposure, and that TNAP was unexpectedly localized near the inner mitochondrial membrane. TNAP inhibition decreased phosphocreatine dephosphorylation and respiration in vitro, and Alpl deletion in adipocytes in vivo induced obesity when mice were fed a HFD [99]. This suggests that TNAP in adipocytes, in addition to liver TNAP, plays an important role in the development of MetS.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Several important points remain to be explored after these pioneer studies on TNAP in adipocyte mitochondria. The first one is how TNAP localization to the cell membrane or to the mitochondria is controlled. To our knowledge, TNAP lacks classical mitochondrial addressing signals. Interestingly, an article published in this issue reports that TNAP is also likely associated with mitochondria in bone and muscle progenitor cells [94]. In these cells, TNAP inhibition increased mitochondrial respiration and ATP production [94], providing molecular evidence to understand why TNAP-deficient mice, sheep and humans have mitochondria with disorganized cristae and/or reduced muscle strength [15,94,103]. Whether these effects are associated or not with changes in the creatine phosphorylation status is unknown but deserves investigation. Additionally, deciphering whether TNAP can be dynamically relocated from a location to another or whether cell membrane TNAP and mitochondrial TNAP represent independent TNAP pools appears to be an important question to address. Finally, the second point to investigate is to what extent this function of TNAP in adipocyte mitochondria modulates the development of MetS, and in particular whether it impacts the development of steatohepatitis [14].\\n\\n4.

It is suspected that TNAP impacts cardiovascular mortality by increasing atherosclerotic plaque calcification [10]. However, recent data indicate that TNAP may exert important functions in several other tissues, such as the liver and adipose tissues (reviewed in [11]). Importantly, total or specific TNAP deficiency in mice fed a HFD exacerbates steatohepatitis [14] and obesity [99], indicating that TNAP may exert protective effects.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\n1. Introduction\\nRegional odontodysplasia (ROD) is uncommon developmental anomaly, which tends to be localised and involves the ectodermal and mesodermal tooth components [1]. This anomaly has no reported association with any specific racial group; however female is slightly more affected than male at ratio of 1.4\\u2009:\\u20091 [1]. Although this anomaly usually affects dental tissues, case reports have documented the presence of regional odontodysplasia with epidermal nevus syndrome [2, 3], hypoplasia of the affected side of the face [4], hypophosphatasia [5], hydrocephalus and mental retardation [6], and ipsilateral vascular nevi [4, 7]. The etiology remains uncertain of many possible causes that have been proposed in the literature. This included somatic mutation of the dental lamina [8], viral infection [9], medication taken during pregnancy [10], local circulating disorder like vascular nevi on the skin of the affected side of the face [11, 12], failure of migration, and differentiation of neural crest cells [2].'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Regional odontodysplasia typically affects one quadrant of the jaw, although it does occasionally cross the midline [7, 13–15]; however there are few cases where this anomaly has affected either the maxillary and mandibular quadrants of the same side [16, 17] or both quadrants of the same jaw [16, 18] and it is extremely rare for the anomaly to affect all four quadrants [13, 19]. Affected teeth are usually in a continuous series, although it may skip a tooth or a group of teeth [12]. Primary teeth affected by this anomaly are usually followed by affected permanent successors; however it is very rare to find normal permanent teeth to follow affected primary ones [20]. Patients with regional odontodysplasia usually present with pain and dental abscess formation [21–23] which can be seen even in the absence of dental caries [24]. Other presenting complaints include delay or failure of eruption [14, 25], gingival swelling [26, 27], and abnormal clinical appearance of the teeth [1]. Clinically, affected teeth are usually smaller than normal with a rough surface texture and extensive pits and grooves. The enamel is hypocalcified and/or hypoplastic with a yellow or brown discolouration and can be soft on exploration with a dental probe [27]. Affected teeth are more susceptible to dental caries due to defective mineralisation [28, 29]. Radiographically, teeth with ROD have shortened roots with open apices [30]. The distinctive “ghost appearance” of these teeth is due to the wide pulp chamber [1, 22, 24] and the reduced thickness of enamel and dentine with loss of demarcation between these tissues.\\n\\nIn this report, we describe a case of regional odontodysplasia with generalised enamel defects in the primary dentition.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"2. Case Report\\nA 5-year-old Caucasian female attended the consultant clinic at Paediatric Dental Department of Leeds Dental Institute, following a referral by her general dental practitioner regarding malformed deciduous teeth. The child's chief complaint on presentation was pain from the teeth in upper right quadrant. The pain started one week ago; it was associated with eating and it lasted for a short period. She did not suffer from any dental infection or associated facial swelling. The patient's perinatal and medical history was noncontributory and the mother reported no previous family history of dental anomalies.\\n\\n2.1. Clinical Examination\\nExtraoral examination revealed no pathological features. Intraorally the mucosa had normal colour and texture. In the maxillary arch, the first primary molars had hypomineralized and hypoplastic enamel defects with 54 more severely affected with rough and irregular surface, which had a yellow brown discolouration (Figure 1). The crown of 55 was broken down with only the root remaining below the gingival level. The upper incisors had mild enamel opacity on the labial surfaces and 53 showed enamel pitting (Figure 2). The mandibular arch had a normal number of teeth and the primary molars appear more yellowish in colour (Figure 3). The mesial marginal ridge of 74 had localised enamel opacity and the incisal half of the 72's labial surface had a hypoplastic defect.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"2.2. Radiographic Examination\\nThe patient's general dental practitioner sent an orthopantomogram (OPG) radiograph (Figure 4) and we have taken bitewing radiographs for caries assessment and diagnosis. The radiographic image showed 55 and 54 with classical radiographic features of “ghost teeth,” with a thin radioopaque contour, showing poor distinction between the enamel and dentine and wide pulp chamber. 55 had very thin retained roots with complete loss of the crown. 15, 16, and 17 are developmentally delayed in relation to the corresponding teeth on the contralateral side of the arch and displaying the characteristic features seen in teeth with regional odontodysplasia. Although 54 is affected by ROD, the permanent successor appears to be in the same developing stage as the other first premolars. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, our diagnosis was regional odontodysplasia and generalised enamel defects.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.3. Treatment\\nThe initial treatment plan included extraction of 55, stainless steel restoration of 54 and 64 under local anaesthesia, and caries preventative program that included regular fluoride varnish, casein phosphopeptides and amorphous calcium phosphate applications, and fissure sealant of the primary molars. However, on a subsequent visit, 54 become infected and a draining sinus developed buccal to that tooth. Hence, the treatment plan has changed to include extraction of 54 and removal of the remaining roots of 55 under local anaesthesia. The planned treatment was done under local anaesthesia over several visits (Figures 5 and 6). The removal of the remaining roots of 55 was not possible without raising a flab and bone removal because of the thin roots. Hence, the clinical decision was to remove the superficial part and leave the remaining part of the root as it is not infected. Extracted 54 and remaining roots of 55 were sent for histopathological examination. Following the eruption of the upper left first permanent molar there was deep fissure with area of enamel opacity on the mesial aspect of the palatal wall. Hence, the tooth was fissure sealed using Fuji Triage™ to prevent plaque accumulation.\\n\\n2.4. Histology Report\\nThe histopathology report for the sent specimen (54 and remaining roots of 55) described malformed enamel with underlying irregular, poorly mineralised dysplastic dentine. The pulp shows nonfusion of one pulp horn. The center of the pulp shows necrotic material with inflammatory cells associated with mineralisation. The report confirmed the clinical and radiographic diagnosis of regional odontodysplasia.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"2.5. Follow-Up\\nFifteen months following the initial assessment the patient's oral condition remains stable with no evidence of dental disease. The patient was placed on a regular follow-up schedule at the department to monitor the eruption of the teeth affected by this anomaly and the presence of mineralisation defects in the remaining permanent teeth and assessing its severity to consider the treatment options and future dental care.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3. Discussion\\nThe presented case shares many features abundantly described in patients with regional odontodysplasia; these include slight gender tendency toward female [1] and unilateral involvement of maxilla which is twice as common to mandibular involvement [1]. However, there are few features which are rarely reported like radiographic evidence of a normally developing permanent successor (upper right first premolar) to follow affected primary predecessor (upper right first primary molar) [20] or the generalised enamel hypomineralization and hypoplasia affecting the other primary teeth which have not been reported in any case of regional odontodysplasia. The enamel defects seen in teeth with ROD are usually severe [13, 27]; however the remaining teeth usually have normal enamel and dentine [1]. In this case, the severity and pattern of mineralisation defects seen in the unaffected teeth by ROD, mineralization of the permanent successors, size of the pulp, and radiographic features do not conform with the diagnosis of ROD. These defects are likely to be developmental defect of enamel (DDE) in the primary dentition. The DDE in primary teeth are relatively common with prevalence ranging from 8.4% to 48.0% [31, 32] and in primary teeth of healthy children in developed countries ranging from 24% to 49% [33, 34]. Many risk factors have been associated with the development of DDE and it includes medical conditions [35, 36], social factors [37], medical problems during pregnancy [38], absence of breast feeding [38], nutritional problems [37], and mutation in the amino acid sequence of amelogenin gene [39]. The high prevalence of developmental defect of enamel in the primary dentition, the diversity of the risk factors, and clinical presentation favour the diagnosis of DDE.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Treatment of ROD remains a clinical dilemma as it is controversial with lack of consensuses in managing this anomaly. Early extraction of the affected teeth has been proposed by many authors [13, 16, 22, 27] as these teeth might develop dental pathology even in the absence of dental caries due to the thin enamel layer and the presence of enamel and dentinal cleft which allow ingress of microorganism to the dental pulp [1]. In addition, the defective mineralisation of the involved teeth results in undesirable appearance and poor dental aesthetics. The extraction was followed in some cases by prosthetic replacement [40, 41]. Some authors have argued for maintaining the noninfected affected teeth to allow normal jaw development and reduce the risk of psychological trauma associated with premature tooth loss [24, 27]. Other treatment approaches in ROD include coverage restorations [25] and autotransplantation of teeth in the permanent dentition [20]. The management of ROD involves interventional dental care in both dentitions and it requires multidisciplinary care. The present case was managed by extraction of the affected teeth which is in agreement with previous reports in the literature [16] and stabilising the remaining primary teeth. The patient is under regular follow-up in the department to assess the developing permanent dentition affected by ROD and to determine the extent of involvement and severity of the generalised enamel hypomineralization and plan future dental care accordingly.\\n\\n4. Conclusion \\nROD in the primary dentition can be easily mistaken for grossly carious teeth. However early diagnosis of this condition is important as it involves both dentitions and usually requires multidisciplinary care.\\n\\nCompeting Interests\\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interests in producing this paper.\\n\\nFigure 1 Broken down 55 to subgingival level and hypomineralization and hypoplasia of 54 and 64.\\n\\nFigure 2 The lower arch.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nRelevance of mineralized nodules in two‐dimensional (2D) osteoblast/osteocyte cultures to bone biology, pathology, and engineering is a decades old question, but a comprehensive answer appears to be still wanting. Bone‐like cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and mineral were all reported but so were non‐bone‐like ones. Many studies described seemingly bone‐like cell‐ECM structures based on similarity to few select bone features in vivo, yet no studies examined multiple bone features simultaneously and none systematically studied all types of structures coexisting in the same culture. Here, we report such comprehensive analysis of 2D cultures based on light and electron microscopies, Raman microspectroscopy, gene expression, and in situ messenger RNA (mRNA) hybridization. We demonstrate that 2D cultures of primary cells from mouse calvaria do form bona fide bone. Cells, ECM, and mineral within it exhibit morphology, structure, ultrastructure, composition, spatial–temporal gene expression pattern, and growth consistent with intramembranous ossification. However, this bone is just one of at least five different types of cell‐ECM structures coexisting in the same 2D culture, which vary widely in their resemblance to bone and ability to mineralize. We show that the other two mineralizing structures may represent abnormal (disrupted) bone and cartilage‐like structure with chondrocyte‐to‐osteoblast transdifferentiation. The two nonmineralizing cell‐ECM structures may mimic periosteal cambium and pathological, nonmineralizing osteoid. Importantly, the most commonly used culture conditions (10mM β‐glycerophosphate) induce artificial mineralization of all cell‐ECM structures, which then become barely distinguishable. We therefore discuss conditions and approaches promoting formation of bona fide bone and simple means for distinguishing it from the other cell‐ECM structures. Our findings may improve osteoblast differentiation and function analyses based on 2D cultures and extend applications of these cultures to general bone biology and tissue engineering research.

       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmcIntroduction\\n\\nDebated for many decades, the physiological relevance of in vitro cell culture models for bone biology and pathology studies is still an enigma. Bone is a complex organ with structural, mechanical, endocrine, hematopoietic, and other functions whose regulation involves interactions between multiple organs.( 1 , 2 , 3 ) Nonetheless, studies of bone biology and pathology at cellular and molecular level often require explant or cell cultures that do not have these functions and mimic only a subset of bone properties.( 4 , 5 , 6 ) Although simplification is a feature of any model, the problem here is the lack of consensus on which bone properties need to be mimicked for a broader relevance of bone cell cultures.\\n\\nCell culture applications range from bone tissue engineering to mechanistic studies of bone cell functions.( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) One of the simplest and most common applications is mineralization assays for osteoblast differentiation.( 4 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ) For instance, effects of mutations, gene knockout/knockdown, and different compounds on osteoblasts are assessed from overall mineral deposition or formation of mineralized nodules in cell culture( 8 , 14 , 15 ) revealed by staining the mineral with Alizarin red( 17 , 18 ) or Von Kossa.( 19 ) With some variations, this assay is used for primary cells from murine and human bones, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived cells, and immortalized osteoblast cell lines.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Although hundreds of papers published each year study osteoblasts and osteocytes in culture, interpretation of the results in terms of physiologically relevant differentiation and function of these cells is debatable. On one hand, a few features consistent with in vivo bone have been reported for some cultures, including mineral crystals,( 20 , 21 ) collagen fiber and cell morphology,( 20 , 22 , 23 , 24 ) and gene expression.( 8 , 24 ) On the other hand, non‐bone‐like matrix, poor survival of matrix‐embedded cells, artificial mineralization induced by cell necrosis and β‐glycerophosphate (βGP), and other significant differences from in vivo bone have also been observed.( 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ) A part of the problem is the lack of detailed and systematic investigations of different types of structures formed in culture, which would integrate structural, ultrastructural, and functional characterization of cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and mineral. Not surprisingly, disparate published observations that used different cells and media as well as different criteria for bone‐like structures and mineralization produced inconsistent conclusions.\\n\\nTo address the problem of physiological relevance, we reexamined various mineralized and unmineralized cell‐ECM structures formed by cultured primary osteoblasts from murine calvaria and murine calvarial osteoblast cell line MC3T3‐E1. Specifically, we investigated how these in vitro structures compare with in vivo bone and surrounding tissue by integrating multiple techniques at different structural and functional levels. From this comparison, we identified which of these structures result from normal, physiological differentiation and function of osteoblasts.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Here, we demonstrate that cultured primary osteoblasts form a mineralized cell‐ECM structure consistent with bona fide bone at all tested levels. Yet they also form multiple distinct types of other, previously uncharacterized structures that are more prevalent at common culturing conditions. The bona fide bone structure has lamellar ECM with in‐vivo‐like composition, structure, ultrastructure, and collagen and mineral densities. It is typically covered by osteoid and a cell‐ECM structure resembling cambium layer of calvarial periosteum. Its formation and growth in culture resembles in vivo intramembranous ossification. Its surface osteoblasts and embedded osteocytes are similar to calvarial cells in morphology and gene expression. These cells survive for weeks, enabling their long‐term studies. The other, more prevalent types of cell‐ECM structures formed in culture are highly variable and have fewer or no characteristic features of normal in vivo bone. They do not represent normal, physiological osteoblast differentiation and function, although they might be interesting and useful for studies of pathological conditions. Importantly, we also show that crucial differences between the physiological and other cell‐ECM structures are masked by artificial mineralization at 10mM βGP commonly used in osteogenic media. We believe that these findings and our simple recipes for growing and identifying physiologically relevant cell‐ECM structures in osteoblast cultures may have important implications for bone biology and bone engineering studies.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nAnimals'),\n",

In top view (Figs.\\xa01B , S5A,B, and S6A), CBL consisted of round or elongated, moderately opaque bone‐like spicules, which often interconnected into a network with trabeculae‐like appearance characteristic of early intramembranous ossification.( 48 ) In 5‐week cultures, CBL covered 1%–2% of total and 5%–10% of mineralized area, and its formation was not significantly affected by 1mM βGP or 10nM Rap (Fig.\\xa01C ). At 10mM βGP, CBL formed as well but could not be easily distinguished and quantified due to rampant mineralization of surrounding structures (Figs. 9E and 10B ).\\n\\nECMs of CBL and parietal bone had similar collagen fiber density and appearance in TEM images, both within regions of higher (Fig.\\xa04D ) and lower (Fig.\\xa0S7) matrix density (Table\\xa01).

Notably, 10mM βGP further reduced the carbonate content (Fig.\\xa08G, p <\\u20090.001).

Mineral crystal orientation relative to collagen fibers was also close to the femur cortex regions that had similar organization of collagen fibers, as revealed by polarized Raman spectra (Fig.\\xa08D ).

ECM of the mineralized, plate‐like DBL sublayers had lower volume fraction of collagen fibers than CBL; its fibers were less fused and had smaller and more tightly distributed diameters (Table\\xa01, Figs.\\xa05A and S2B). This ECM lacked lamellar organization and was more heterogeneous, exhibiting much higher variation of the volume fraction of collagen fibers and of the fraction of fused fibers than all other cell‐ECM structures formed in culture (Table\\xa02). Unmineralized sublayers within DBL had lower collagen fiber density than mineralized DBL sublayers yet higher than LP (Fig.\\xa05A , middle and bottom layers of panels 1 and 2, respectively). DBL surface cells had Sp7, Col1a1, and Bglap transcription comparable to CBL osteoblasts (Fig.\\xa09B,C ). Most cells inside DBL were not completely surrounded by mineralized ECM (Fig. 5A), but their ultrastructure as well as Dmp1 and Sost expression were often similar to CBL osteocytes (Fig.\\xa09B,C ). In the top view, DBL could be distinguished from CBL by the irregular/corrugated growing edge, lack of well‐defined mineralization front, and lack of well‐organized and clearly visible osteocyte lacunae (Figs.\\xa01B and 5B,C ). During early stages of formation, DBL often exhibited multiple events of bone nodule nucleation at the same location (Fig.\\xa0S5C ), apparently resulting in poorly organized, stacking layers of osteoblast‐like cells and matrix (Figs.\\xa05A and 9C ), whereas CBL exhibited a single nucleation and osteoblast‐like layers only on the top and bottom (Figs.\\xa09B and S5C). Unlike CBL, DBL had some embedded cells with no Dmp1 and Sost expression (white asterisks, Fig.\\xa09C ).

The presence of the latter cells within chondrocyte‐like lacunae (encircled arrows, Fig.\\xa09F ) may indicate chondrocyte to osteoblast/osteocyte transdifferentiation.\\n\\nArtificial ECM mineralization at 10mM βGP'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='At 10mM βGP, the same LP, CBL, DBL, OM, and ESL cell‐ECM structures were distinguishable initially (Fig.\\xa010B ) but disrupted and camouflaged later by rampant mineralization upon inorganic phosphate release from βGP by alkaline phosphatases (ALPs). At early stages, we observed formation of mineral granules within and next to areas of high ALP activity (Fig.\\xa010A ). The granules formed even within LP and OM layers that did not mineralize without βGP or at 1mM βGP. Raman microspectroscopy of areas with sparse collagen fibers revealed the granules to be hydroxyapatite with no preferred crystal orientation, which were likely formed by nonspecific calcium phosphate precipitation.( 42 ) This granular mineralization occurred irrespective of ECM morphology, eventually filling all culture regions except for extended LP areas not overlaying other structures (Figs.\\xa01A,B and 10A,B ). The rampant mineralization altered gene expression (cell differentiation) and appeared to kill some cells (large regions of fully mineralized culture contained numerous empty cell lacunae). Additionally, 10mM βGP could alter osteoblast differentiation directly as it delayed mineralization in subclone 4 of MC3T3‐E1 cell line (no mineral formed in 5\\u2009weeks, Fig.\\xa0S4B ). In CBL at 10mM βGP, the mineral carbonate content was reduced but overall mineral and collagen contents, mineral orientation, and mineral deposition within gap regions of collagen fibers were normal (Figs.\\xa08G and 10C ).'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Another curious artifact of high βGP concentration was abnormal nucleation of needle‐like mineral crystals at cell surfaces (Fig.\\xa010C ), which was likely induced by cell surface phosphatases hydrolyzing βGP and was not observed without 10mM βGP. The contribution of this process to overall mineralization and its effect on cellular function were difficult to evaluate, because these crystals were detectable only by electron microscopy of fixed samples. We did not observe mineralization caused by calcium release from organelles of dying cells and subsequent calcium phosphate precipitation in cell lacunae and pericellular matrix, which was previously reported as another artifact at high βGP.( 27 , 29 , 52 )\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nIt is known that outcomes of mineralization experiments vary with cell source, preparation, seeding density, culture media, and other conditions.( 4 , 8 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 19 , 25 , 28 , 53 , 54 ) However, the diversity of bone‐like and other cell‐ECM structures, their physiological relevance, and the role of cell culture conditions in this diversity have not been fully appreciated. Our study suggests that full understanding of mineralized cultures requires: (i) identifying structures produced by primary osteoblasts at low concentrations (≤1mM) of βGP, a supplement not required for bone‐like mineralization; (ii) identifying effects of cell culture conditions on these structures and their mineralization; and (iii) identifying potential artifacts caused by artificial (nonphysiological) mineralization at more commonly used higher βGP concentrations.\\n\\nBona fide bone formation by cultured primary cells'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Probably the most important lesson from this study is that primary mouse PBCs cultured on a 2D substrate can progress through differentiation from osteoblast precursors to mature osteocytes and form CBL with many features of lamellar bone. ECM and mineral composition (Fig.\\xa08G ), growth pattern (Figs.\\xa04C , S5B,C, and S6), ECM and cell morphology, ECM and cell ultrastructure (Figs.\\xa04A,B,D and S7), and cell phenotypes (gene expression, Fig.\\xa09B ) in CBL are similar to perinatal parietal bone. Top view transmission images of trabeculae‐like structures resembling CBL reported previously in rat calvarial cell cultures at 2mM βGP( 29 , 54 ) suggest that CBL may form in other experimental settings as well.\\n\\nPBCs also form DBL with several features of bone but poorly organized bone‐like ECM and intrusions of non‐bone‐like ECM and cells (Figs.\\xa05A,C and 9C ). Time‐lapse tracking of formation (Fig.\\xa0S5B,C ) and gene expression imaging (Fig.\\xa09B,C ) suggest that the non‐bone‐like ECM and cell intrusions into DBL may be entrapped upon nucleation and growth of overlaying bone nodules rather than caused by disrupted osteoblast differentiation. Thus, DBL might be related to in vivo woven bone, and distinguishing CBL and DBL might not be essential for evaluating osteoblastic differentiation. Fgf23 expression in response to active vitamin D (Fig.\\xa09G ) suggests that osteocytes embedded in CBL and DBL are functional. Altogether, multiple techniques suggest that CBL is bona fide bone, and DBL might be a cell culture proxy of bone.\\n\\nDiverse cell‐ECM structures and cell differentiation outcomes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Another key lesson is the observed diversity of mineralized and unmineralized cell‐ECM structures in culture. In addition to CBL and DBL, PBC cultures formed mineralized ESL structures that do not represent the osteogenic potential of the cells. ESL has ECM, mineralization pattern, cellular morphology, and gene expression indicative of mixed chondrogenic and osteogenic cell differentiation and possibly chondrocyte to osteoblast transdifferentiation (Figs.\\xa07, 8, 9). Partial chondrogenic differentiation of PBCs might be an artifact of in vitro culture, shifting the cells from intramembranous ossification toward cartilaginous mineralization, eg, due to transient incubation at 5% oxygen used in this work. Still, ESLs might be of interest for future studies given the reports of chondrocyte‐like osteoprogenitor cells( 55 , 56 ) and chondrocyte‐to‐osteoblast trans differentiation in vivo.( 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 )\\n\\nTwo other types of abundant cell‐ECM structures in PBC cultures are unmineralized and exhibit only artificial mineralization at high βGP concentrations. OM structure morphologically resembles osteoid, but its growth pattern, size, shape, and collagen density (Figs.\\xa06 and 8, Table\\xa02) are distinct from a cell culture version of the physiological osteoid (Figs.\\xa05B and S5A). Gene expression in most of the cells embedded in OM indicates deficient osteocytic differentiation (Fig.\\xa09D ), but we do not know the cause of this deficiency and whether it is related to nonmineralizing osteoid observed in bone pathologies.( 1 ) LP structures growing alone or coating other structures (Fig.\\xa03) are produced by cells not differentiated into mature osteoblasts (Fig.\\xa05). Morphologically and ultrastructurally, LP resembles the cambium layer of parietal or femoral periosteum, but we do not know whether it is a useful cambium model (Fig.\\xa03). Detailed analysis of OM and LP cell‐ECM structures was beyond the scope of this work but might be of interest for future studies.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Distinguishing mineralized CBL, DBL, and ESL as well as unmineralized LP and OM structures may thus be beneficial for the analysis of normal and pathological osteoblast differentiation in culture. However, imaging techniques traditionally used in cell culture mineralization assays, particularly the approaches based on mineral staining, can hardly discriminate between these structures and may be misleading. Gene expression profile of the whole culture may also be insufficient to indicate normal osteoblast differentiation because cells in non‐bone‐like OM and ESL structures express mature osteoblast and osteocyte genes (Fig.\\xa09D,F ). In contrast, all these structures are easily distinguishable in live or fixed, unstained cultures under a conventional cell culture microscope with moderate magnification and optimal settings as described in Materials and Methods.\\n\\nCell‐ECM structures formed by MC3T3‐E1 cells'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We also found that MC3T3‐E1 subclone 4 cells, which is a popular model for studying osteoblast biology in culture, do form mineralized structures with some resemblance to CBL yet exhibit deficient osteocytic differentiation (Figs.\\xa02, S3, and S4A,C,D). Osteocyte‐like cells in these structures are much sparser than in CBL or DBL structures formed by primary PBCs (Figs.\\xa04A and S4C). MC3T3‐E1 subclone 4 cells have low expression of Alpl, Dmp1, Mepe, and Sost (Fig.\\xa02) and form fewer and shorter processes not connected into extended networks when embedded in mineralized matrix (Fig.\\xa0S4C ). Nonetheless, the mineralized structures and expression of osteoblast markers (Fig.\\xa02) are consistent with using this cell line for recapitulating some features of osteoblasts.( 61 ) MC3T3‐E1 cells also provide a useful model for investigating how osteoblasts produce, fold, and traffic procollagen.( 34 , 62 , 63 ) Still, one needs to keep in mind that collagen matrix reported for even better mineralizing subclone 14 of MC3T3‐E1 cells( 64 ) is less dense and more disorganized than matrix of CBL or bone in vivo (Figs.\\xa06D and S7).\\n\\nCulture conditions affecting osteogenic differentiation\\n\\nCBL and DBL areal fractions depend on the culture medium and other conditions (see, eg, Fig.\\xa01C ). Given known serum effects on shifting progenitor differentiation toward osteoblasts, chondrocytes, or adipocytes, our experiments were performed with serum pretested to support differentiation of mouse BMSCs into osteoblasts. Additionally, our media for primary cells were always supplemented with 100μM Asc2P because ascorbic acid is essential for maintaining collagen synthesis and therefore normal osteoblast function.( 31 , 33 ) MC3T3‐E1 cells were differentiated in the same media supplemented with Asc2P but had to be maintained in undifferentiated state using media without Asc2P or ascorbic acid, which could affect their differentiation capacity.\\n\\nCell expansion'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Cell expansion\\n\\nBecause osteoblast environment (surrounding cells, ECM, and culture dish surface) affects osteoblast differentiation( 53 ) and because mature osteoblasts do not proliferate, the approach to expanding cells to confluency might affect subsequent cell differentiation. Cell expansion in growth media without added Asc2P or ascorbic acid is common, yet it may affect the capacity of the cells to undergo subsequent osteogenic differentiation because of severe disruption of osteoblast ER by accumulating procollagen.( 34 , 65 ) In our experience, expanding primary cells in the growth medium supplemented with 100μM Asc2P in a regular incubator with atmospheric (~20%) oxygen ensured efficient CBL and DBL formation when the cells were seeded at ~10,000/cm2 or higher density. CBL and DBL formation at lower seeding density was inconsistent, apparently because 20% O2 inhibits cell proliferation.( 35 , 36 ) An alternative approach described in the present study is seeding fewer cells at ~2000/cm2, expanding to confluency at 5% O2 (promoting proliferation without affecting differentiation potential( 35 , 66 )) and differentiating at ~20% O2. Interestingly, cultures expanded in growth medium with 100μM Asc2P and subsequently incubated at 5% O2 for a month deposited thick cell‐ECM layer and had similar expression of Ibsp, Bglap, Dmp1, Mepe, Phex, and Sost to cultures transferred to 20% O2 at confluency, but they did not mineralize in the absence of βGP. This observation is consistent with a previous study.( 67 )\\n\\nOsteogenic differentiation'),\n",

       "[Document(page_content='Deficient expression and/or activity of TNAP enzyme in humans causes a rare, heritable disorder called hypophosphatasia (HPP). Hypophosphatasia in humans has a broad range of severity that corresponds with timing of onset. Symptoms range from lethal and/or severe with perinatal or infantile onset (29), to modest and milder forms with childhood and adult onset (30, 31). Through a series of preclinical studies conducted on the Alpl−/− mouse model of infantile hypophosphatasia (TNAP−/− mice), a mineral-targeted recombinant form of TNAP was developed (32, 33). This recombinant enzyme was initially tested in patients with life threatening disease and was shown to improve respiratory function, skeletal mineralization and survival in patients with severe perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia (34, 35). More recent results confirm safety and longer-term efficacy of this enzyme replacement therapy. In a 7 year follow up to the original trial, skeletal healing was sustained with additional improvements over time in treatment for respiratory function, weight, height, fine motor, gross motor and cognitive skills (36). While this drug is clearly life rescuing and life changing for severely affected hypophosphatasia patients, symptoms such as muscle weakness and craniosynostosis (the premature fusion of growing cranial bones) are not alleviated with treatment (37).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nHypophosphatasia is a rare heritable metabolic disorder caused by deficient Tissue Non-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (TNAP) enzyme activity. A principal function of TNAP is to hydrolyze the tissue mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. ENPP1 (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1) is a primary enzymatic generator of pyrophosphate and prior results showed that elimination of ENPP1 rescued bone hypomineralization of skull, vertebral and long bones to different extents in TNAP null mice. Current TNAP enzyme replacement therapy alleviates skeletal, motor and cognitive defects but does not eliminate craniosynostosis in pediatric hypophosphatasia patients. To further understand mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis development in hypophosphatasia, here we sought to determine if craniofacial abnormalities including craniosynostosis and skull shape defects would be alleviated in TNAP null mice by genetic ablation of ENPP1. Results show that homozygous deletion of ENPP1 significantly diminishes the incidence of craniosynostosis and that skull shape abnormalities are rescued by hemi- or homozygous deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice. Skull and long bone hypomineralization were also alleviated in TNAP−/−/ENPP1−/− compared to TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice, though loss of ENPP1 in combination with TNAP had different effects than loss of only TNAP on long bone trabeculae. Investigation of a relatively large cohort of mice revealed that the skeletal phenotypes of TNAP null mice were markedly variable. Because FGF23 circulating levels are known to be increased in ENPP1 null mice and because FGF23 influences bone, we measured serum intact FGF23 levels in the TNAP null mice and found that a subset of TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice exhibited markedly high serum FGF23. Serum FGF23 levels also correlated to mouse body measurements, the incidence of craniosynostosis, skull shape abnormalities and skull bone density and volume fraction. Together, our results demonstrate that balanced expression of TNAP and ENPP1 enzymes are essential for microstructure and mineralization of both skull and long bones, and for preventing craniosynostosis. The results also show that FGF23 rises in the TNAP−/− model of murine lethal hypophosphatasia. Future studies are required to determine if the rise in FGF23 is a cause, consequence, or marker of disease phenotype severity.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='DISCUSSION\\n\\nTNAP (Tissue Non-specific Alkaline Phosphatase) enzyme deficiency leads to the metabolic disorder hypophosphatasia in mice and humans with a primary phenotype of bone hypomineralization (9, 29–31). The phenotype of severe hypophosphatasia in mouse pups and human infants can also include craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of cranial bones leading to diminished skull growth, high intracranial pressure and an abnormal skull shape (29, 38, 49). Treatment of infants and children with severe hypophosphatasia using a recombinant, mineral-targeted form of TNAP has been highly successful for improving survival, and for rescuing bone mineralization plus motor and cognitive deficiencies. Unfortunately, the recombinant enzyme therapy has been less efficacious for preventing craniosynostosis (36). In this study we primarily sought to determine if ablation of the pyrophosphate generating enzyme, ENPP1, in TNAP null mice would rescue craniosynostosis and associated craniofacial skeletal abnormalities because deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice was previously shown to rescue skeletal mineralization (13) and to further understand mechanisms that mediate the craniofacial abnormalities in hypophosphatasia.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Discussion\\nNSHPT is a rare genetic disorder which presents in the first few weeks of life with poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia, respiratory distress and failure to thrive, all of which are non-specific symptoms and signs of common neonatal problems [2]. Failure to recognise the problem early and initiate appropriate treatment promptly is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and a mortality rate of greater than 50% [3].\\n\\nIn the absence of widely-available rapid molecular testing, a diagnosis relied on identifying the typical clinical presentation and biochemistry. A typical presentation and severe hypercalcaemia in an infant born to consanguineous parents were highly suggestive of NHSPT, and further testing which revealed high PTH levels and typical radiological features was highly suggestive in our patient.\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis of neonatal hypercalcaemia includes idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia, William syndrome, subcutaneous fat necrosis, vitamin D intoxication and hypophosphatasia; all of which are associated with low PTH levels.\\n\\nCinacalcet is an allosteric activator of the CaSR, increasing its sensitivity to extracellular calcium leading to a decrease in PTH output. Homozygous inactivating mutations of CaSR are known to be non-responders to calcimimetics [5], as seen in our patient.\\n\\nIn patients whom cinacalcet was successful, a significant calcium reduction was seen within a couple of days. A dramatic response in the PTH and calcium levels were seen 2 days after cinacalcet (0.4mg/kg/day) [6]. Therefore, in the absence of rapidly-available genetic testing, a lack of response to a trial of cinacalcet should suggest homozygous mutations.')]"
