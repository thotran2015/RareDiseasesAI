       " Document(page_content='==== Body\\npmcIntroduction\\n\\nAtraumatic femoral fractures are frequently encountered in clinical practice. The femur is the largest weight-bearing bone providing attachments to powerful antigravity muscles and a few of the strongest ligaments and tendons of the body and endures considerable biomechanical forces. In addition to traumatic injuries, the femur is susceptible to fractures even without significant trauma under certain clinical conditions; e.g. metabolic bone disease. Atraumatic fractures, contrary to those following trauma, present with vague symptoms, occult on imaging posing challenges during diagnosis. We will describe non-traumatic femoral fractures, their imaging features and differentials in the article. In the end, we will outline to approach these fractures.\\n\\nTerminologies\\n\\nTerminologies used to describe atraumatic fractures are confusing and often overlap.\\n\\nAtraumatic fracture term donates a fracture caused by a relatively low-energy mechanism that usually considered incapable of producing a fracture.1 This broad category includes pathological, stress, fatigue, insufficiency and atypical femoral fractures.\\n\\nStress fractures, partial or complete, usually result in bones unable to withstand subthreshold stress applied in a rhythmical and repeated manner.2 Such fractures can be of two types: fatigue fractures – from abnormal repetitive stress causing temporal mechanical failure – in a normal and insufficiency fractures – owing to normal stress on an abnormally weakened bone.3 The term “Fragility fracture” is exclusive for insufficiency fractures in osteoporosis following single minimally traumatic event.1,4\\n\\nPathological fractures are insufficiency fractures occurring in a bone weakened by benign or malignant neoplastic lesion affecting its trabecular integrity (Figure 1). By the same definition, fracture through osteomyelitis is regarded as a pathological fracture.1,5 (Supplementary Figure 1).'),\n",

AP, anteroposterior.\\n\\nFatigue fractures\\n\\nThese are focal fractures in the normal bone due to repetitive stress following sustained microdamage exceeding the bone’s ability to heal employing physiological remodelling. Frequent in young, suboptimally conditioned individuals who abruptly engage in strenuous activities such as weekend-warriors with limited physical fitness, military recruits, and athletes who abruptly intensify their training regimen,6 they are also common after orthopaedic surgery in lower limbs, foot in particular where altered gait and osteopaenia following guarded mobility in post-surgical period implied as causative factors.7\\n\\nThe femur is the fourth common bone affected by stress injuries accounting for approximately 7.2% cases in athletes.8 The femoral neck (50%), the condylar area (24%) and the proximal shaft (18%) are commonly affected anatomical sites and can be bilateral (9% cases).9 The medial aspect is at risk and commonly affected due to biomechanical forces exerted on it during weight-bearing and muscle exertion. Compressive forces pass through the medial shaft; whereas, tensile forces act upon the lateral aspect when one bears the weight – the latter is substantially lesser relieved by the iliotibial tract and vastus lateralis action – in contrast of dynamics of vastus medialis, adductor longus and brevis increasing medial compression force.10,11'),\n",

Radiographically, the earliest finding is a subtle lucency in the cortex often described as “Grey cortex sign”12 from microfracture and osteoclastic resorption (Figure 2) followed by periosteal reaction, and cortical thickening on progression because of periosteal and endosteal remodelling and callus formation.1 As it lags behind the osteoclastic activity by a few weeks, the periosteal reaction is not visible until several weeks into the disease process.7 Cortical breaks may be visible in injuries inciting severe bony responses.\\n\\nFigure 2. 35-year-old female amateur marathon runner with Fatigue fracture in the femoral diaphysis where cortical bone predominates.

The heralding finding is faint blurring and sclerosis of the trabeculae. Following which, linear intramedullary sclerosis due to microcallus becomes evident (Figure 3). For fatigue fractures, MRI is the gold-standard imaging modality with the highest sensitivity and specificity,13 however, specificity of MRI may be low for early changes of fracture. Marrow oedema in presence or absence of periosteal reaction is the earliest imaging finding. In more established injuries, a fracture line may be visible appearing as a linear hypointense line on all imaging sequences, usually followed by periosteal and endosteal callus formation.'),\n",

Fractures from compressive stresses and located along the medial aspect of the femur are considered low risk as they tend to reduce with weight bearing and usually managed conservatively. Fractures due to tensile stress, such as fractures along the superolateral aspect of the femoral neck which occur perpendicular to the tensile trabeculae are considered high risk which needs extended rehabilitation, may result in a delayed union or even progress to complete fractures unless treated. Those with a fracture line involving more than 50% of the width of the femoral neck and displaced fractures are also considered high risk and need aggressive management.1\\n\\nFemoral fatigue fractures are typically from compression stress and can be managed conservatively by rest and restricted activities. MRI findings are used to grade the severity of the fatigue fractures and to ascertain return to play or recovery time. (Table 1). According to Arendt grading of stress fractures, time required to return to sports is approximately 3 weeks for Grade 1 injury, 3–6 weeks for Grade 2 injury, 12–16 weeks for Grade 3 injury with Grade 4 injury requiring more than 16 weeks of rest15 (Table 2).\\n\\nTable 1.

       "[Document(page_content='Deficient expression and/or activity of TNAP enzyme in humans causes a rare, heritable disorder called hypophosphatasia (HPP). Hypophosphatasia in humans has a broad range of severity that corresponds with timing of onset. Symptoms range from lethal and/or severe with perinatal or infantile onset (29), to modest and milder forms with childhood and adult onset (30, 31). Through a series of preclinical studies conducted on the Alpl−/− mouse model of infantile hypophosphatasia (TNAP−/− mice), a mineral-targeted recombinant form of TNAP was developed (32, 33). This recombinant enzyme was initially tested in patients with life threatening disease and was shown to improve respiratory function, skeletal mineralization and survival in patients with severe perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia (34, 35). More recent results confirm safety and longer-term efficacy of this enzyme replacement therapy. In a 7 year follow up to the original trial, skeletal healing was sustained with additional improvements over time in treatment for respiratory function, weight, height, fine motor, gross motor and cognitive skills (36). While this drug is clearly life rescuing and life changing for severely affected hypophosphatasia patients, symptoms such as muscle weakness and craniosynostosis (the premature fusion of growing cranial bones) are not alleviated with treatment (37).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\\n\\nHypophosphatasia is a rare heritable metabolic disorder caused by deficient Tissue Non-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (TNAP) enzyme activity. A principal function of TNAP is to hydrolyze the tissue mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. ENPP1 (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1) is a primary enzymatic generator of pyrophosphate and prior results showed that elimination of ENPP1 rescued bone hypomineralization of skull, vertebral and long bones to different extents in TNAP null mice. Current TNAP enzyme replacement therapy alleviates skeletal, motor and cognitive defects but does not eliminate craniosynostosis in pediatric hypophosphatasia patients. To further understand mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis development in hypophosphatasia, here we sought to determine if craniofacial abnormalities including craniosynostosis and skull shape defects would be alleviated in TNAP null mice by genetic ablation of ENPP1. Results show that homozygous deletion of ENPP1 significantly diminishes the incidence of craniosynostosis and that skull shape abnormalities are rescued by hemi- or homozygous deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice. Skull and long bone hypomineralization were also alleviated in TNAP−/−/ENPP1−/− compared to TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice, though loss of ENPP1 in combination with TNAP had different effects than loss of only TNAP on long bone trabeculae. Investigation of a relatively large cohort of mice revealed that the skeletal phenotypes of TNAP null mice were markedly variable. Because FGF23 circulating levels are known to be increased in ENPP1 null mice and because FGF23 influences bone, we measured serum intact FGF23 levels in the TNAP null mice and found that a subset of TNAP−/−/ENPP1+/+ mice exhibited markedly high serum FGF23. Serum FGF23 levels also correlated to mouse body measurements, the incidence of craniosynostosis, skull shape abnormalities and skull bone density and volume fraction. Together, our results demonstrate that balanced expression of TNAP and ENPP1 enzymes are essential for microstructure and mineralization of both skull and long bones, and for preventing craniosynostosis. The results also show that FGF23 rises in the TNAP−/− model of murine lethal hypophosphatasia. Future studies are required to determine if the rise in FGF23 is a cause, consequence, or marker of disease phenotype severity.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='DISCUSSION\\n\\nTNAP (Tissue Non-specific Alkaline Phosphatase) enzyme deficiency leads to the metabolic disorder hypophosphatasia in mice and humans with a primary phenotype of bone hypomineralization (9, 29–31). The phenotype of severe hypophosphatasia in mouse pups and human infants can also include craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of cranial bones leading to diminished skull growth, high intracranial pressure and an abnormal skull shape (29, 38, 49). Treatment of infants and children with severe hypophosphatasia using a recombinant, mineral-targeted form of TNAP has been highly successful for improving survival, and for rescuing bone mineralization plus motor and cognitive deficiencies. Unfortunately, the recombinant enzyme therapy has been less efficacious for preventing craniosynostosis (36). In this study we primarily sought to determine if ablation of the pyrophosphate generating enzyme, ENPP1, in TNAP null mice would rescue craniosynostosis and associated craniofacial skeletal abnormalities because deletion of ENPP1 in TNAP null mice was previously shown to rescue skeletal mineralization (13) and to further understand mechanisms that mediate the craniofacial abnormalities in hypophosphatasia.'),\n",

Failure to recognise the problem early and initiate appropriate treatment promptly is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and a mortality rate of greater than 50% [3].\\n\\nIn the absence of widely-available rapid molecular testing, a diagnosis relied on identifying the typical clinical presentation and biochemistry. A typical presentation and severe hypercalcaemia in an infant born to consanguineous parents were highly suggestive of NHSPT, and further testing which revealed high PTH levels and typical radiological features was highly suggestive in our patient.\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis of neonatal hypercalcaemia includes idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia, William syndrome, subcutaneous fat necrosis, vitamin D intoxication and hypophosphatasia; all of which are associated with low PTH levels.\\n\\nCinacalcet is an allosteric activator of the CaSR, increasing its sensitivity to extracellular calcium leading to a decrease in PTH output. Homozygous inactivating mutations of CaSR are known to be non-responders to calcimimetics [5], as seen in our patient.\\n\\nIn patients whom cinacalcet was successful, a significant calcium reduction was seen within a couple of days. A dramatic response in the PTH and calcium levels were seen 2 days after cinacalcet (0.4mg/kg/day) [6].
