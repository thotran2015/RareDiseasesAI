Molecular bases of HPP are various muta-\\ntions in the ALPL gene (1p36.12, NCBI Gene-ID:249) which is coding\\nfor the ectoenzyme tissue-nonspeci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase [1].\\nThe predominant phenotype of this hereditary disease in its severe\\nearly onset manifestation is characterized by impaired bone minerali-\\nzation and by disorganized growth plates with consecutive\\nmalformations [1]. Moreover, lung hypoplasia and functional impair-\\nment of the CNS , including epileptic seizures, may contribute toearly death within weeks after birth [2]. Less severe forms of the dis-\\nease with infantile, adolescent or even adult onset present with de-layed bone mineralization, muscular problems like dynopenia,\\nnephrocalcinosis, poor renal function or problems with the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract [1]. Focusing on CNS-related issues, above all adult pa-\\ntients complain about sleep disturbances and neuropsychiatricBone 79 (2015) 150 –161\\nAbbreviations: 36B4, ribosomal protein, large, P0; AADC, aromatic L-amino acid decar-\\nboxylase; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALPL/TNAP/Akp2, tissue-nonspeci ﬁc alkaline phospha-\\ntase; AT, annealing temperature; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine\\ndiphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CNS, central\\nnervous system; CNTNAP2, contactin associated protein-like 2; DCX, doublecortin; EEF1A,eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid; GAD, glutamate decarboxyl ase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate de-\\nhydrogenase; HPP, hypophosphatasia; MAP2, mi crotubule-associated protein 2; NEUN, RNA-\\nbinding protein, fox-1 homolog 3; NFASC, neurofascin; NPY, neuropeptide Y; NRP1,neuropilin 1; NRXN1, neurexin 1; NSE, enolase 2, gamma neuronal; P2X7, purinergic recep-tor P2X, ligand gated ion channel, 7; PBS, phosp hate buffered saline; PGCs, primordial germ\\ncells; PHOSPHO1, phosphatase, orphan 1; PI, prot ease inhibitor; PL, pyridoxal; PLP, pyridoxal\\n5′phosphate; PRKCA, prot ein kinase c, alpha; RA, all-trans retinoic acid; RAR β,r e t i n o i ca c i d\\nreceptor β; RLU, relative light unit; ROBO2, roundabout, axon guidance receptor, homolog\\n2; SEM, standard error of mean; SEMA3A, semap horin 3A; SVZ, subventricular zone; TAU,\\nmicrotubule-associated protein tau.\\n⁎Corresponding author at: Children's Hospital, Section of Pediatric Rheumatology and\\nOsteology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.Fax: +49 931 201627794.\\nE-mail address: hofmann_c5@ukw.de (C.

Another key player in this system\\nis the phosphatase PHOSPHO1 which supports the initiation of hy-droxyapatite deposition in matrix vesicles whereas TNAP enables prop-\\nagation of the newly formed crystals outside the vesicles [6,7] .A sa\\nconsequence, combined ablation of PHOSPHO1 and TNAP completelyprevents skeletal mineralization [7]. In addition, adenosine triphos-\\nphate (ATP), diphosphate (ADP) and monophosphate (AMP) are fur-ther substrates for TNAP [8,9] thus contributing to changes in the\\nmicroenvironmental concentrations of purine-derived compoundsthat orchestrate purinergic signaling via a series of receptors and\\nligand-modulated channels as well as adenosine receptors. Purinergic\\nsignaling is relevant in several tissues including bone and the central\\nnervous system [10].\\nNo brain-speci ﬁc transcripts of TNAP have been found so far as all\\nanalyzed neuronal and endothelial cells in humans, marmosets and\\nrats solely express the bone speci ﬁcALPL transcript, whereas mouse\\nneurons also express liver transcripts [11]. Moreover, expression of\\ntissue-nonspeci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase changes in accordance with\\nthe developmental stage of the brain [11]. In the human neocortex\\nTNAP expression can be found in layer 5 throughout the frontal-,\\ntemporal- and occipital lobes [12]. Further, alkaline phosphatase activi-\\nty is localized in the neuropile alongside the thalamo-cortical innerva-tions in layer 4 of primary visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices\\nand furthermore varies depending on sensory experience. Subcellular\\nlocalization of TNAP enzyme is characterized by accumulation at synap-\\ntic junctions during maturation, its distribution matches GAD\\n65localiza-\\ntion at presynaptic terminals and apart from that alkaline phosphataseis distributed alongside the axon solely in myelin-free parts [13,14] .\\nConsistent with those results Hanics et al. published that TNAP knock-\\nout mice ( Akp2\\n−/−) display severe dysfunctions as far as central pro-\\ncesses like myelination and maturation of synapses are concerned[15]. Moreover, TNAP enzyme might in ﬂuence migration of primordial\\ngerm cells (PGCs) and neurons due to its ability of interaction withextracellular matrix proteins like collagen and further regulates prolif-\\neration and differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons or oligo-\\ndendrocytes [16,17] . Experiments with murine neurons isolated\\nfrom hippocampus samples revealed a connection between TNAP andaxonal growth. TNAP staining shows prominent signals in somatic and\\naxonal regions. The strongest signals are located at axon terminals and\\nbranching points, whereas only weak signals could be detected in den-\\ndrites [18]. TNAP inhibition impairs axonal growth signi ﬁcantly, proba-\\nbly due to elevated ATP levels that activate P2X7 receptors at the growthcone, which prevents axonal growth. In contrast, no effects of TNAP\\ninhibition could be seen on dendritic outgrowth [18]. Moreover, TNAP\\nmight in ﬂuence neurogenesis during mouse brain development and\\nexpression was found in the subventricular zone in adult mouse\\nbrains, which is one of the few regions where adult neurogenesis\\ntakes place [19]. Above all, TNAP is crucial for vitamin B\\n6metabolism\\nas only the transport form pyridoxal (PL) is able to cross the blood –\\nbrain barrier and functional TNAP is indispensable for dephosphory-\\nlation of pyridoxal-5 ′-phosphate (PLP). PL is activated through re-\\nphosphorylation after passing the blood –brain-barrier and serves\\nas a cofactor for enzymes playing a central role in neurotransmitter me-\\ntabolism, like aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and gluta-\\nmate decarboxylase (GAD) which regulate synthesis of serotonin,dopamine, (nor-)/adrenalin and GABA [20–22]. A recent publication de-\\nscribes quite conserved TNAP localization in the retina across manyspecies and therefore suggests a potential role for retinal neurotrans-\\nmission [23].\\nIn order to reveal further details about the molecular function of\\nTNAP in neuronal systems we established a neuroblastoma cell line\\nwhich stably over-expresses TNAP enzyme (SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhigh) and com-\\npared its gene expression patterns and morphology with and without\\ntreatment with neurogenic differentiation media to parent cells (SH-\\nSY5YTNAPlow). Using this human in vitro model turned out to be a very\\npromising tool in order to con ﬁrm and extend knowledge on the role\\nof alkaline phosphatase concerning neurogenic differentiation and mat-\\nuration. Literature gives information about localization of TNAP in\\nmouse brains [17,24] and about the enzyme's role during axonal growth\\nin murine hippocampal neurons [18]as well as during differentiation of\\nmurine neural stem cells [16]. Information about the distribution in the\\nhuman neocortex was gained from histological analysis [12,13] . Using\\nour in vitro model, we are able to further dissect the role of TNAP on\\nconsecutive events during differentiation and maturation in neuronal\\ncell lines of human origin.\\nWe can demonstrate here that TNAP overexpression profoundly\\ninﬂuences outgrowth of cellular processes and expression of neuronal\\ndifferentiation markers during neuronal cell differentiation, indicatingthat TNAP is capable of modulating intercellular communication in\\nthe CNS. Interestingly only certain cells in layer 4 and layer 5 of the\\nhuman neocortex are TNAP positive whereas surrounding cells are not\\n[12,13] . Our established in vitro model enables us to analyze possible\\nroles of those cells in human context and provides additional knowl-edge to previously published literature data gained in mouse models.\\nMaterials and methods\\nCell culture\\nNeuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (ATCC:CRL-2266) was kindly pro-\\nvided by Prof. Lesch (Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and\\nPsychotherapy, University of Wuerzburg, Germany) and cultured in\\nDMEM Ham's F12 media (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt,\\nGermany) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Biochrom\\nAG, Berlin, Germany), 100 nM sodium selenite and 50 μg/ml gentamicin\\n(both Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany).

The signal at approximately 80 kDa re-\\nsembles the functional, post-translationally modi ﬁed protein and is\\nvery prominent in the SH-SY5YTNAPhighcell line, whereas no detectable\\nsignal can be seen in SH-SY5YTNAPlowand SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1.

The activity of the enzyme was tested in a CSPD-assay.\\nIt is over 1000-fold elevated in SH-SY5YTNAPhighwhole cell lysates com-\\npared to SH-SY5YTNAPlow(pb0.001) and SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1which proves\\nthe biological functionality of the overexpressed protein and the verylow TNAP levels in the control cells. As values around 25 –30 RLUs can\\nbe considered as background, no difference after levamisole treatmentin SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlowand SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1can be detected. 5 mM of the\\nTNAP-speci ﬁc inhibitor levamisole are able to minimize the signal ap-\\nproximately 0.02-fold (p b0.001) in SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells ( Fig. 1 C).\\nConsistent with the Western blot results and the functional activity,the positive ﬂuorescence signal in SH-SY5YTNAPhighclariﬁes the expect-\\ned localization of TNAP in the cell membrane.

Furthermore,\\nGOstat analysis of up-regulated genes reveals an over-representationof gene groups containing above all relevant genes for neurogenesis,\\naxon growth and neuron development ( Table 3 ).\\nGenes of interest were selected for biological validation of in silico\\ndata, based on the results of GOstat analysis and the respective fold\\nchanges, and subsequently analyzed via qPCR, using ﬁve biological rep-\\nlicates of each cell line.

Graser et al. / Bone 79 (2015) 150 –161Based on the results of the microarray analysis and of subsequently\\nperformed experiments, we decided to examine TNAP's impact on\\nthe process of neurogenic differentiation more closely. We therefore\\nperformed ﬂuorescence staining, qPCRs and morphological analyses.\\nTNAP is localized throughout the whole cellular processes and co-localized\\nwith synapsin I at some spots\\nAtﬁrst immunocytochemical staining with speci ﬁc antibodies\\nagainst TNAP ectoenzyme was carried out in order to visualize its local-ization in growing processes during neurogenic differentiation of SH-\\nSY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells. Fig. 2 A shows that TNAP (green) is located at the\\nmembrane of the cell bodies as well as throughout the whole cellularprojection network. Moreover, some cells show clustered TNAP staining\\nat speci ﬁc spots of the processes. In order to analyze, whether those\\nspots are branching points or developing synapses, we performeddouble-staining of TNAP and synapsin I ( Figs. 2 B–E). Those experiments\\nreveal strong signals for the synaptic marker synapsin I and TNAP atsome tips of the cellular processes, respectively at spots where two pro-\\ncesses get in touch with each other after 72 h of treatment. Nonetheless,\\nonly some cells show this phenomenon and by far not all. Additional\\nanalysis of synapsin I expression at day 8 of neurogenic differentiation\\nreveals a clear increase of positive signals within the network comparedto day 3, but no clear correlation between strong TNAP and synapsin I\\nsignals could be seen (data not shown). Cells treated with mouse and\\nrabbit serum (white box) do neither show green nor red ﬂuorescence\\nsignals, excluding reactivity of the secondary antibodies with unspeci ﬁc\\nmouse or rabbit antigens.\\nTypical neuronal markers show higher expression levels in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhigh\\nthan in SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells in the course of neurogenic differentiation\\nIn order to prove whether RA stimulation causes a response within\\nthe cells, the expression of the receptor RAR β, which is known to be\\nup-regulated by RA stimulation [31], was analyzed. The relative expres-\\nsion changes of RARß in SH-SY5YTNAPlowis 6.879 fold (p = 0.010) after\\ntreatment with RA (1 day) compared to t 0, which shows a robust and\\nsigniﬁcant up-regulation of the RAR βgene after treatment. Interesting-\\nly, SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells show a fold change of 17.845 comparing stim-\\nulated cells at day 1 to untreated ones at t 0(p = 0.003).\\nAdditionally performed RT-PCRs with SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells show an\\nincrease of TNAP expression after treatment with RA (Suppl. Fig. 1).\\nConsequently, the stimulation with RA induces changes in speci ﬁc\\ngene expression patterns. As SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells show a stronger re-\\nsponse to stimulation with RA, consistent with a higher susceptibility\\nto neurogenic commitment, we wanted to examine whether typical\\nneuronal markers like MAP2 and NEUN are also up-regulated in a stron-\\nger manner. Analysis of marker genes by qPCR indicates that NEUN,\\nTAU, NPY and NSE show a higher expression level in TNAP overexpress-\\ning cells from day 1 until day 10. NEUN and NPY increase their expres-\\nsion only in SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells, whereas TAU and NSE show a\\nprominent rise in both cell lines. MAP2 and NFASC interestingly showa higher expression level in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells between day 1 and\\nday 6, but SH-SY5YTNAPlowshow a sudden increase resulting in a higher\\nexpression of those genes compared to TNAP positive cells at day 10\\n(Fig. 3 ). We also analyzed the expression of the typical stem cell marker\\nnestin, but did not see any signi ﬁcant decrease neither in SH-\\nSY5YTNAPlownor in SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells during our experimental\\nsetup (data not shown). PRKCA expression stays on a high level in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcompared to SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells and shows just slight\\nchanges in expression levels during treatment with differentiation me-dium. SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlowcells show a signi ﬁcant decrease in PRKCA ex-\\npression at day 6. NRP1 expression rather stays on a signi ﬁcantly\\nlower level in SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells compared to SH-SY5YTNAPlowday\\n1 whereas those cells show a slight decrease in expression duringdays 3 and 6. NRP1 ligand SEMA3A, which has been described as an in-\\nhibitor of neurite outgrowth [32], shows a slight reduction of its expres-\\nsion level in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlow, interestingly in an analogous manner\\ncompared to NRP1 expression. Expression of SEMA3A however, does\\nnot change prominently during treatment in SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells\\n(Fig. 3 ).\\nNeuronal marker MAP2 shows higher expression in SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells\\non protein level after 3 days of treatment with neurogenic differentiationmedium\\nStaining of SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlow, SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1and SH-SY5YTNAPhigh\\ncells with a speci ﬁc antibody for the microtubule-binding protein\\nMAP2, which plays an important role e.g. during the outgrowth of\\nneurites [33], reveals the strongest ﬂuorescence signal in the cells\\nwith the highest TNAP expression ( Fig. 4 ).

Interestingly, SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells do not change their MAP2\\nexpression on RNA levels until day 6, but due to a sudden increase, the\\nexpression of MAP2 is even higher in those cells after reaching day 10 of\\ntreatment. The latter observation might further indicate a retarded\\ndifferentiation procedure in cells with low TNAP expression.\\nSH-SY5YTNAPhighcells have longer processes after treatment with neurogenic\\ndifferentiation medium\\nAs GOstat analysis, qPCR results and MAP2 immunostaining provid-\\ned an indication of TNAP's in ﬂuence during neurogenic differentiation\\nwe further compared the cell lines concerning their morphology.

SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells\\nare able to create a precise network structure of long and quite branchedcellular processes ( Fig. 5 A). None of the three cell lines abandons prolif-\\neration completely during treatment with differentiation media.\\nProjection lengths of individual cell lines were measured on coded\\npictures with ImageJ 1.49j and mean values of the different approacheswere compared to each other. Mean values of all measured processes\\nfrom three independent experiments are depicted in Fig. 5 B, ordered\\nby cell lines and time points. From the very ﬁrst day of treatment SH-\\nSY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells show the longest processes. The most obvious dis-\\ncrepancy can be seen after 4 days of treatment with neurogenic differ-entiation media as SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlowand SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1cell lines have\\na mean projection length of 62.42 and 68.74 μm whereas TNAP overex-\\npressing cells show a mean of 98.88 μm. The total maximum value is\\nreached by SH-SY5YTNAPhighat day 6 of the experimental setup. At this\\ntime point SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells have a mean projection length of\\n114.29 μm, SH-SY5YTNAPlow73.74 μm and SH-SY5YpcDNA3.167.37 μm.\\nSH-SY5YTNAPlowcells show a 2.5-fold increase of projection length dur-\\ning the whole process, whereas the SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1cell line does not\\nshow any noteworthy increase of length after day 4. In contrast, SH-\\nSY5YTNAPhighcells increase their processes' lengths 3.1-fold between t 0\\nand day 8. For statistical analysis two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoctest were calculated. SH-SY5Y\\npcDNA3.1cells have signi ﬁcantly shorter\\nprocesses than the other two cell lines (SH-SY5YTNAPlowpb0.001; SH-SY5YTNAPhighp = 0.011) at the starting point t 0and signi ﬁcantly shorter\\nthan SH-SY5YTNAPhighat day 1 (p = 0.006). At days 4 and 6 of neurogen-\\nic differentiation the SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells have signi ﬁcantly longer pro-\\ncesses than SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1and SH-SY5YTNAPlow(all p-values b0.001).\\nAt day 8 SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1cells have signi ﬁcantly shorter processes com-\\npared to the other two cell lines (both p-values b0.001).\\nDouble staining for TNAP and either for tau or MAP2 was performed\\nin SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells in order to unravel the nature of the outgrown\\ncellular processes in the course of differentiation. Those experiments re-veal an increase of MAP2 and tau signals during differentiation in a sub-\\npopulation of the cells, indicating that those cells generate cellular\\nprocesses which are developing in the direction of either axonal or den-\\ndritic structures respectively (Suppl. Figs. 2 and 3). We get the impres-sion that tau protein is located throughout the whole length of the\\ncellular processes until the rami ﬁed tips, whereas MAP2 is above all con-\\ncentrated at the origin of the processes and weakens in the direction ofthe tips. We were not able to ﬁnd a clear correlation between TNAP local-\\nization and tau or MAP2 staining, since TNAP was actually prevalent inthe whole cellular membrane in a very high concentration. Whether\\nthe outgrown cellular processes are able to transmit neuronal signals in\\na proper manner needs to be determined in future experiments.\\nDiscussion\\nSince data from mouse genetics, clinical CNS-related symptoms\\nof patients suffering from HPP and the physiological expression pattern\\nof TNAP in the human CNS suggest a speci ﬁc role of tissue-nonspeci ﬁc\\nalkaline phosphatase in neuronal tissues, we intended to furtherunravel the molecular mechanisms by creating a transgenic neuroblas-\\ntoma cell line, which is constantly overexpressing the ALPL gene (SH-\\nSY5Y\\nTNAPhigh). We are able to prove the stable integration of the overex-\\npression construct into the genome of SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells, which have\\nvery low endogenous TNAP activity, by analysis of genomic DNA withspeci ﬁc primer combinations. Moreover, semi-quantitative PCRs and\\nWestern blot analysis show that the level of TNAP mRNA as wellas protein cells is much higher in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcompared to SH-\\nSY5YTNAPlowand SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1cells respectively.

Enzymatic assays with CSPD re-\\nagent as a substrate proof the functionality of the synthesized enzyme\\nand show that the TNAP-speci ﬁc inhibitor levamisole [34]inhibits enzy-\\nmatic activity to a great extent ( Figs. 1 A–D).\\nAfter characterization of the established cell lines with different\\nTNAP activity levels, a comparison between those cells was done inorder to gain further information about TNAP's role in neuronal sur-\\nroundings. Nevertheless, one must take into consideration that huge\\ndifferences in TNAP activity levels might on the one hand intensify\\neffects, but on the other hand one needs to be aware that SH-\\nSY5Y\\nTNAPlowcells might lack some key players, which are relevant in\\nanalogous processes in the body since they have such a low endogenousAP. But taking into consideration that experiments with primary cells\\nlike murine hippocampal neurons [18] provided similar results gives\\nconﬁdence in our human cell culture model.\\nMicroarray analyses comparing untreated SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlowand SH-\\nSY5YTNAPhighcells (Table 3 ) as well as differentiated ones (data not\\nshown) reveal an interesting effect of TNAP on processes involved inneurogenesis like projection development which goes along with previ-\\nousﬁndings published by Diez-Zaera et al. [18]. Comparison of gene\\nexpression of SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighand SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells shows a signif-\\nicant down-regulation of neuropilin 1 and its ligand semaphorin 3A. The\\nlatter regulates axon growth cone collapse via Rab5 [35]and can act as\\nan axon repellent as well as an attractant depending on cGMP and cAMPpathways [36]. Moreover, NRP1 and SEMA3A were found to provoke\\ndistal axonopathy and muscle denervation in mouse models for amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [37]. Differential gene regulation of\\nthose two genes proposes an additional mechanism of projection devel-opment regulation via TNAP apart from controlling the availability of its\\nsubstrate ATP which was previously suggested [18]. Another interesting\\naspect is that semaphorins contribute to growth inhibition of axons ininjured neurons of the central nervous system [32], suggesting a possi-\\nble role of TNAP during regeneration of neurons after injury. Sema3A isfurther involved in polarization of neurons and regulates branching of\\ndendrites [38,39] . Expression of genes encoding doublecortin, neurexin\\n1 and protein kinase C αwas increased in TNAP overexpressing cells.\\nDCX is a microtubule-associated protein that is involved in migration\\nand differentiation of immature neurons e.g. during development of\\nthe cortex [40]. Moreover, a lack of DCX correlates with the appearance\\nof spontaneous epileptic seizures [41]which is indeed very interesting\\nas some severely affected HPP patients also suffer from seizures corre-\\nlating with the level of available pyridoxal-5′ -phosphate in the brain\\n[2]. Langer et al. found that TNAP is located in immature cells of prolif-\\nerative zones in brains of mouse embryos as well as in the\\nsubventricular zone (SVZ) of adults and seems to decrease during\\nprogressing neuronal maturation [19]. Nevertheless, a certainpopulation of young neurons of the SVZ shows co-expression of DCX\\nand TNAP [19]. Furthermore, Neurexin 1 is involved in synaptic adhe-\\nsions and differentiation of neurons [42]. PRKCA was found to be\\nenriched in growth cones of differentiating SH-SY5Y cells, and therefore\\na role during neurite outgrowth was proposed previously [43]. Addi-\\ntionally, ROBO2 is involved in axonal guidance [44] and NEUN has\\nbeen described as a speci ﬁc neuronal protein located in the nucleus\\n[45]. CNTNAP is known for mediating cell-cell interactions in the\\nnervous system and consequently e.g. involved in schizophrenia and\\nmajor depression [46]. In summary qPCR results further emphasize\\nTNAP's role in neuronal surroundings by suggesting differential expres-sion of genes involved in relevant processes of neurogenesis.\\nImmunocytochemical stainings of SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells after 72 h of\\nneurogenic differentiation reveal localization of TNAP in the cell mem-\\nbrane surrounding the cell bodies as well as throughout the wholelength of the cellular processes ( Fig. 2 A). Prominent ﬂuorescence signals\\nfor TNAP were co-localized with synaptic marker synapsin I at somespots ( Figs. 2 B–E), going along with the ﬁndings made in hippocampal\\nneurons which showed strong TNAP staining, above all at terminalends of the processes [18]. Interestingly, the number of synapsin I posi-\\ntive sites in the established network structure increases considerablyafter 8 days of neurogenic differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesize\\nthat SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells develop at least synaptic-like structures, trig-\\ngered by treatment with differentiation medium. Nonetheless, addi-tional electrophysiological analyses are indispensable in order to gain\\ninformation about the functionality of those structures. However, we\\nwere not able to see a clear correlation between TNAP localization and\\nsynapsin I at this time point. Due to their intense and continuous\\nTNAP expression SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells probably have limitations\\nfor the analysis of ﬁne and distinct subcellular localization and\\nco-localization of TNAP with other subcellular markers. Nonetheless,\\nthe lack of glia cells must be considered as another limitation of our\\nmodel, since astrocytes are known to be involved in processes\\nlike maintenance of homoeostasis at synapses as well as regulation\\nthe synaptic activity [47].\\nIn order to test whether cells with higher TNAP activity show en-\\nhanced differentiation, we compared expression of neuronal markers\\nvia qPCR at different time points of treatment with neurogenic differen-\\ntiation medium. A striking ﬁnding was the strong reaction of SH-\\nSY5YTNAPhighcells towards stimulation with RA which was leading to a\\ndramatic upregulation of its receptor RAR β. Being less pronounced\\nin SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells, this effect leads to the assumption that\\ncells with a higher TNAP activity show a higher susceptibility to neuro-\\ngenic commitment which is ﬁnally leading to an acceleration of the\\ndifferentiation process. The upregulation of TNAP expression in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPlowcells after treatment with RA (Suppl. Fig. 1) further\\nFig. 4. MAP2 (red) staining of SH-SY5YTNAPlow,S H - S Y 5 YpcDNA3.1and SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells after 72 h treatment with differentiation medium shows the strongest staining in SH-\\nSY5YTNAPhighcells. Blue ﬂuorescence represents DAPI-staining of the nucleus. Reactivity of the secondary antibody with unspeci ﬁc mouse antigens was excluded since no staining\\ncould be seen in samples which were treated with mouse serum instead of the primary antibody (white box). Pictures were taken at 20× magni ﬁcation and scale bar represents\\n20μm. Experiment was repeated four times independently. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)158 S. Graser et al. / Bone 79 (2015) 150 –161supports this hypothesis. Going along with our ﬁndings, Wan et al. ob-\\nserved an upregulation of TNAP expression by chromatin remodeling\\nat promoter regions of the gene which was triggered by RA [48].\\nThe expression of selected marker genes in the course of neurogenic\\ndifferentiation ( Fig. 3 ) indicates that SH-SY5YTNAPhighcells seem to be\\nsomehow ahead of SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells concerning their differentia-\\ntion status. Taken together, those data suggest that TNAP activity\\nmight be more important at earlier stages of neurogenic differentiation.This goes along with ﬁndings made by Langer et al. who proposed a de-\\ncrease of TNAP activity during maturation of neurons in mouse brains\\n[19]. NEUN is a widely-used neuronal marker as it is solely expressed\\nin neurons, more speci ﬁcally located in their nuclei, and might be re-\\nsponsible for neuron speci ﬁc splicing processes [45]. NPY regulates syn-\\naptic transmission and is furthermore involved in anxiety disorderswhich can also be seen in HPP patients [49,50] . Moreover higher expres-\\nsion levels of NSE and NFASC in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells gives further proof\\nFig. 5. A.

Mean values and SEM were calculated from a total of 240 values (at least 140) for a certain cell line at a certain time point.Two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test were calculated with the program SPSS. *p b0.05; **p b0.01; ***p b0.001.159 S. Graser et al. / Bone 79 (2015) 150 –161of enhanced differentiation into a neuronal phenotype. Interestingly,\\nneurofascin is important for the establishment of saltatory conduction\\nalong myelinated axons [51] and speculations about a contribution of\\nTNAP to the process of myelination have been published as well [15].\\nSurprisingly, SH-SY5YTNAPlowcells show a clear increase of NFASC ex-\\npression at the late time points, which might indicate that those cellsgradually catch up with the TNAP over expressing cell line over time.\\nAbove all the microtubule-binding protein tau is constantly\\nexpressed on a higher level in SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighthan in SH-SY5YTNAPlow\\ncells and a clear increase in expression is obvious on RNA and protein\\nlevels ( Fig. 3 , Suppl. Fig. 2) in both cell lines in the course of the differen-\\ntiation process. Tau plays a role in polarization of neurites [52] and is\\ntranslocated from the nucleus to cytosol during the differentiation pro-\\ncess[53]. Additionally, we observed higher MAP2 protein expression in\\nSH-SY5YTNAPhighcells compared to the other two cell lines ( Fig. 4 )a s\\nwell as an increased expression of MAP2 on the protein level in the\\ncourse of neurogenic differentiation in some cells (Suppl. Fig. 3). Micro-\\ntubule-binding proteins like MAP2 and tau play a central role in stabiliz-\\ning microtubules, consequently providing axonal transport [54].M A P 2\\nand tau seem to have complementary functions during the outgrowthof neurites, since MAP2 is above all necessary for the initiation and tau\\nfor the elongation of the cellular processes [33]. Moreover, MAP2 is\\nmainly concentrated in dendrites [55], whereas tau protein is usually\\nlocalized in the axon and was also found to be associated with the mem-\\nbranes of Golgi apparatus [56]. However, high expression of tau is also in-\\nvolved in pathological neuronal cell death like it has been described inprion disease as increased total tau protein and hyperphosphorylation\\nof tau are associated with terminal stages of this disease [29,54] .T h e r e\\nis also a connection between TNAP and Alzheimer's disease (AD) asserum and brain levels of TNAP correlate with severity of AD. Progres-\\nsion of the disease and subsequent neurodegeneration can be further\\npromoted by TNAP as the enzyme dephosphorylates extracellular tau\\nwhich afterwards activates muscarinergic receptors and ﬁnally causes\\nneuronal death [57,58] . Taken together, we see a clear indication of a\\nnecessity for TNAP during neuronal development and neurogenic dif-\\nferentiation which is going along with previously published clinical\\nﬁndings [2]and triggered via stimulation of relevant proteins. In con-\\ntrast, high levels of TNAP enzyme may propagate certain neurodegener-ative conditions in pathology.\\nA participation of TNAP in the process of neurogenesis and projec-\\ntion development could further be con ﬁrmed by the observation of\\nmorphological differences between the cell lines during treatment\\nwith neurogenic differentiation media based on RA. Cells with higher\\nTNAP levels have longer cellular processes and develop networks that\\nare more distinct than the other two cell lines, without clear differences\\nin cell numbers or proportion of processes per cell in between the three\\nexamined cell lines. The reason why values did not constantly increase\\nmight be due to the higher cell density, which causes a lack of space be-\\ntween cell bodies after 6 –8 days. Another possibility might be that mea-\\nsurements in samples with higher cell density can probably not beconsidered as reliable as in the ones with lower cell density since\\nparts of the processes might be covered by cell bodies of neighboring\\ncells and consequently underestimated. It is striking that above all SH-\\nSY5Y\\npcDNA3.1cells stop the continuous elongation of their cellular pro-\\ncesses. We cannot exclude that the integration of the pcDNA3.1 vectorcaused this effect since the exact position of integration into the genome\\nis unknown. However, this observation even intensi ﬁes the effect\\ncaused by TNAP since SH-SY5Y\\nTNAPhighcells were also stably transfected\\nand therefore underwent the analogous procedure as SH-SY5YpcDNA3.1\\ncells.\\nConclusion\\nThe results indicate that TNAP is far more than an indispensable en-\\nzyme for bone metabolism. We could con ﬁrm an in ﬂuence of TNAP on\\nprocesses which are important for proper development of the nervoussystem in our in vitro model. TNAP expression has a clear impact\\non neuronal systems as it in ﬂuences outgrowth of cellular processes\\nand induces higher expression of genes which are playing important\\nroles during myelination, synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth\\n(like NEUN, NSE, MAP2 and TAU). It will be of further interest whether\\nthe results gained from the neuroblastoma cell lines can be con ﬁrmed\\nin primary neural stem cells prepared from our previously published\\nmouse models for hypophosphatasia [59]. In humans TNAP activity can\\nbe assigned to distinct cortical regi ons, corresponding to layers 4 and 5,\\nwhere integration of information from various brain regions takes place\\n[12,13,60] . TNAP might therefore play a role in the ﬁne tuning of the in-\\nformation exchange. Moreover, high TNAP activity may also be involvedin the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases and in atherosclerosis,\\nboth very common age-related diseases [29,57,61,62] . Unraveling the\\nmolecular role of TNAP in systems ins ide and outside the bone will help\\nto improve treatment strategies for HPP patients. Taking this rare disease\\nas a model will also help to dissect TNAP's role in degenerative diseases\\nand might enable future treatment of those common pathologies by\\ntargeting this enzyme.\\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx.\\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2015.05.033 .\\nFunding\\nThis work was funded by HPP patients' organization Hypophos-\\nphatasie Deutschland e.V. and Elsbeth Bonhoff Foundation\\n(Zuwendungsgesuch 109) (Berlin, Germany).\\nConﬂict of interest statement\\nNone to declare.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank Prof. Klaus-Peter Lesch for providing the SH-SY5Y neuro-\\nblastoma cell line and Prof. Anna-Leena Sirén, Barbara Gado, Dr. Regina\\nEbert and Juliane Pochhammer for their helpful support.\\nReferences\\n[1]Whyte MP.

This disease is charac-\\nterized by disrupted bone and tooth mineralization, and reduced serum AP activity.\\nAlong with bone and tooth symptoms, many neurological symptoms, seizure,encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension, mental retardation, deafness, and growthhormone de ﬁciency (GHD), are frequently found in HPP patients. Seizure occurs in\\nsevere HPP types soon after birth, and responds to pyridoxine, but is an indicator oflethal prognosis. Encephalopathy rarely presents in severe HPP types, but hassevere sequelae. Intracranial hypertension complicated in mild HPP types developsafter the age of 1 year and sometimes need neurosurgical intervention. Mental\\nretardation, deafness and GHD are more frequently found in Japanese HPP patients.\\nMental retardation occurs in all HPP types. Deafness in perinatal lethal type is bothconductive and sensorineural. GHD develops in all but perinatal lethal type and thediagnosis tends to delay. The pathogenesis of these neural features of HPP might bedue to impairment of both vitamin B6 metabolism and central nervous systemdevelopment by ALPL mutations.\\nKeywords Seizure\\n/C1Mental retardation /C1Deafness /C1Encephalopathy /C1Growth\\nhormone de ﬁciency\\nT.

According to several\\nreports from Western populations, HPP patients exhibit both autosomal dominant(AD) inheritance and autosomal recessive (AR), while almost all HPP patients inthe Japanese population are AR (Mornet et al. 2011 ; Michigami et al. 2005 ; Ozono\\nand Michigami 2011 ; Watanabe et al. 2011 ). Patients with AR inheritance have a\\nsevere or mild clinical phenotype, whereas those with AD have a mild phenotype\\n(Whyte 2001 ,2010 ; Mornet 2008 ; Mornet et al. 2011 ; Michigami et al. 2005 ;\\nWenkert et al. 2011 ). The clinical severity of HPP often depends on the age of onset\\n(Whyte 2001 ,2010 ; Mornet 2008 ) (see also Chap. 1). The six clinical types of HPP\\nare: (1) perinatal lethal which is apparent at birth; (2) infantile from 1 –6 months;\\n(3) childhood type from the age of 6 months –18 years; (4) odonto type, which is\\ncharacterized by the premature loss of deciduous teeth by 5 years without apparentbone symptoms; and (5) adult. Interestingly, some patients with prenatal onset,namely the prenatal benign type have ameliorated spontaneous skeletal defects and\\nsurvive (Ozono et al. 1996 ; Brun-Heath et al. 2008 ; Wenkert et al. 2011 ). The\\nperinatal lethal type usually has poor prognosis because of a profound reduction ofbone mineralization; half of patients with the infantile type and all patients with thechildhood type survive but experience premature loss of deciduous teeth as well asdelayed walking and waddling, which re ﬂect the degree of the skeletal disease\\n(Whyte 2001 ,2010 ; Mornet 2008 ). Low AP activity contributes to elevated levels\\nof AP substrates, i.e., pyridoxal 5 ′phosphate (PLP), phosphoethanolamine (PEA),\\nand inorganic pyrophosphate (Whyte 2001 ). More than 260 types of ALPL muta-\\ntions have been identi ﬁed in HPP patients, and 80 % of these are missense muta-\\ntions according to the ALPL mutations database ( http://www.sesep.uvsq.fr/03_\\nhypo_mutations.php#mutations ). The phenotypes of HPP patients are also closely\\nrelated to the residual enzyme activity effects of ALPL mutations (Zurutuza et al.\\n1999 ; Mornet 2000\\n). No curative therapy has been established for HPP. Currently,\\nbone-targeted enzyme-replacement therapy, and cell transplantation from bonemarrow and other bone sources are under development (Nishioka et al. 2006 ;\\nWhyte et al. 2003 ,2012 ; Cahill et al. 2007 ; Tadokoro et al. 2009 (see Chap. 15).\\nIn addition to bone and tooth symptoms, patients with HPP present with neu-\\nrological symptoms including seizure, encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension,mental retardation, deafness, and growth hormone de ﬁciency (GHD). This chapter\\ndescribes these neurological symptoms of HPP in detail.310 T. Taketani14.2 Seizure\\nWe summarized several cases of seizures with HPP that have been fully reported\\n(Balasubramaniam et al. 2010 ; Baumgartner-Sigl et al. 2007 ; Bethenod et al. 1967 ;\\nBelachew et al. 2013 ; Demirbilek et al. 2012 ; Hofmann et al. 2013 ; Litmanovitz\\net al. 2002 ; Nunes et al. 2002 ; Sia et al. 1975 ; Smilari et al. 2005 ; Yamamoto et al.\\n2004 ). Seizures of HPP usually occur from days after birth. Only severe types\\nincluding perinatal lethal and infantile type have seizures while perinatal benign,childhood, adult and odonto types have not. Therefore, bone symptoms includinghypomineralization and shortening or deformity of the extremities and respiratoryfailure precede appearance of seizures. But, two cases reported by Baumgartner-Siglet al. ( 2007 ) and Belachew et al. ( 2013 ) developed refractoryseizures before any sign\\nor symptom of HPP, suggesting that intractable seizures in neonates need to suspect\\nHPP. Tonic or/and clonic seizures, myoclonic convulsion and spasm often occur.Complete blood count and blood biochemical examination such as serum electro-lytes, glucose, or ammonia are normal except for low titer of AP. Laboratory ﬁnd-\\nings of bacterial and viral infection in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) are\\nnegative. Electroencephalogram (EEG) ordinarily reveals mono- or multi-focalepileptic discharge. Hypsarrhythmia, a burst-suppression pattern in EEG, sometimesdeveloped, resulting in West syndrome (Balasubramaniam et al. 2010 ;\\nBaumgartner-Sigl et al. 2007 ; Yamamoto et al. 2004 ). Brain computed tomography\\nand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) do not indicate abnormalities. Hofmannet al. ( 2013 )ﬁrst reported that cranial MRI demonstrated progressive cystic and\\ndestructive encephalopathy in an infant without hypoxic –ischemic episode. Seizures\\nare refractory to standard anticonvulsants such as diazepam, phenobarbital, phe-nytoin, clonzepam, or valproic acid. But, pyridoxine (PN, vitamin B6) is the onlyeffective anticonvulsant drug, showing that HPP-related seizures arepyridoxine-responsive seizures (PRS). Initial dosage of PN is 100 mg/day or 30 –\\n60 mg/kg/day, and maintenance dosage is 50 mg/day or 5 –10 mg/kg/day. The\\nduration of PN administration cannot be clari ﬁed because except a single case\\n(Belachew et al. 2013 ) all studied HPP patients with neonatal seizures died within\\nthe age of 18 months, demonstrating that PRS of HPP is an indicator of lethalprognosis compared to ordinary PRS which do not recur after the withdrawal of PN(Basura et al. 2009 ). In the single case survived as reported by Belachew et al. ( 2013 )\\nthe PN supplementation could be stopped without seizure recurrence once enzymereplacement therapy, asfotase alfa (Alexion Pharmaceuticals), a bone-targeted\\nrecombinant TNAP, has been started. This enzyme therapy has been reported to\\nimprove survival and clinical outcome in HPP (Whyte et al. 2012 ). Further details on\\nthis therapy and long-term neurological outcomes will be reported (see Chap. 15).\\nPN-dependent seizure was found in a de ﬁciency of a-aminoadipic semialdehyde\\ndehydrogenase (antiquitin), which is encoded by the ALDH7A1 gene, folinic\\nacid-responsive seizures, which are also caused by antiquitin de ﬁciency, familial\\nhyperphosphatasia (PIGV de ﬁciency) and nutritional vitamin B de ﬁciency (Gospe\\n2010 ; Plecko and St öckler 2010 ). As for PLP-dependent seizure, there is a14 Neurological Symptoms of Hypophosphatasia 311deﬁciency of pridox(am)ine 5 ′-phosphate oxidase which is encoded by the PNPO\\ngene (Gospe 2010 ; Plecko and St öckler 2010 ). It is necessary to con ﬁrm the\\ndiagnosis of PRS because management of each of these diseases differs.\\nThe pathogenesis of PRS in HPP is not understood. Hypotheses have included\\ncranial deformities, intracerebral hemorrhage, and hypoxia (Whyte et al. 1988 ), but\\nmany of HPP patients without these complications have PRS. Interestingly, neo-natal seizure in HPP has a unique metabolic basis due to either accumulation ofsubstrates or diminished products of TNAP-mediated hydrolysis (Whyte 2001 ).\\nHowever, PEA excess in HPP does not appear to explain the occurrence of PRS.Instead, PLP accumulation reveals the important role that TNAP in vitamin B6metabolism: as a plasma membrane-bound ectoenzyme that dephosphorylates PLPto pyridoxal (PL) (Whyte et al. 1988 ). PL is the form of vitamin B6 that crosses cell\\nplasma membranes to be phosphorylated intracellularly to PLP (Whyte et al. 1988 ).\\nPLP is the active metabolite of vitamin B6 and is an essential coenzyme for syn-thesis of various neurotransmitters and biogenic amines. It acts as a co-factor formore than 100 apoenzymes (see Chap. 11). The corresponding holoenzymes\\ncatalyse diverse reactions such as transamination, decarboxylation, racemisation,degradation and replacement. In the brain, PLP-dependent enzymes [aromaticamino acid decarboxylase (AADC), branched-chain amino acid 2-oxoglutarateaminotransferase, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase, glutamate\\ndecarboxylase (GAD), glycine cleavage enzyme, kynureninase, kynurenine ami-\\nnotransferase and L-serine racemase are involved in the metabolism of dopamine,serotonin, glutamate, glycine, GABA, D-serine and taurine (Surtees et al. 2006 )\\n(Fig. 14.1). Although low TNAP activity in HPP causes high circulating (extra-\\ncellular) levels of PLP, plasma PL levels are typically normal (Baumgartner-Sigl\\nPLP PLTNAP\\nPL\\nPLBrain Blood Barrier\\nPLPCell membrane\\nAromatic amino acid decarboxyase \\nBranched-chain amino acid 2-oxogltarate aminotransferase \\nGlutamate decarboxylase \\nGamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase \\nGlycine cleavage enzyme Kynurenine aminotransferase L-serin racemasePLP dependent enzymes\\nFig. 14.1 Role of TNAP in vitamin B6 metabolism for brain. PLpyridoxal, PLP pyridoxal 5 ′\\nphosphate312 T. Taketaniet al. 2007 ) (see also Chap. 1). Occasionally, plasma PL levels are low especially in\\nsevere HPP cases (Whyte et al. 1988 ). Low extracellular levels of PL, and resulting\\nlow brain PLP levels, may lead to decreased activity of PLP-dependent enzymes(Baumgartner-Sigl et al. 2007 ). Analysis of biogenic amines in CSF of HPP patients\\nrevealed an elevated 3-ortho-methyldopa and 5-hydrotryptophan levels anddecreased 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (Balasubramaniam et al. 2010 ;\\nBaumgartner-Sigl et al. 2007 ). Urinary levels of vanillactate were elevated\\n(Balasubramaniam et al. 2010 ). These metabolites indicate functional de ﬁciency of\\nAADC (Fig. 14.2). Only a few primary AADC de ﬁciency patients were reported\\nwith epileptic seizures (Balasubramaniam et al. 2010 ). Moreover, PL/PLP de ﬁ-\\nciency in brain cells (despite normal PLP levels in CSF) reduces GABA synthesisbecause of low GAD activity (Baumgartner-Sigl et al. 2007 ). PLP is a co-enzyme\\nfor GAD, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of GABA (Baxter 2003 ).\\nGABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and when reduced, the unopposed excit-atory neurotransmitters lead to seizure activity (Belachew et al. 2013 ) (Fig. 14.3).\\nStrong support for this hypothesis comes from null homozygous mouse models null\\nfor TNAP gene. These mice have low circulating PL as well as high PLP levels and\\nneonatal seizures that are partially controlled by oral PN/PL (Waymire et al. 1995 ;\\nNarisawa et al. 2001 ). In these mice, low PL and PLP levels in brain tissue (before\\nPN treatment) compromised GAD activity and impaired GABA synthesis.Therefore, inadequate levels of PLP in the neurons might lead to PRS.\\n14.3 Encephalopathy\\nPRS often presents with epileptic encephalitis (Gospe 2010 ). Only one HPP patient\\nprogresses to encephalopathy (Hofmann et al. 2013 ). On the patient ’s seventh day\\nof life, seizures started and rapidly progressed in the following weeks.ADCCTryptophan 5-HTP Serotonin 5-HIAA\\nTyrosine L-DOPA DA HVA\\n3-O-MD\\nVanillactateNA\\nEPIMHPG\\nVMAPLP \\nFig. 14.2 Biochemical pathway related to AADC (modi ﬁed from Balasubramaniam et al. 2010 ).\\nAADC Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase; 5-HTP hydroxytryptophan, 3-O-MD 3-O-methyl-\\ndopa, DA dopamine, LDOPA L-dopamine, NA noradrenaline, EPI epinephrine, 5-HIAA\\n5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, HVA homovanillic acid, MHPG 3-methoxy-4 hydroxyphenylglycol,\\nVMA vanillylmandelic acid, PLpyridoxal, PLP pyridoxal 5 ′phosphate14 Neurological Symptoms of Hypophosphatasia 313Standard EEG during seizures showed severe generalized hypersynchronous\\nactivity but was normal during intermission. Unfortunately, the patient did not showa sustained response to repeated high doses of vitamin B6/pyridoxine, phenobar-\\nbital or levetiracetam. The patient continued to have seizures until he was 6 weeks\\nof age when he was deeply sedated. Discontinuation of the sedative medication didnot lead to consciousness. EEG-follow up showed discontinuous activity withhigher amplitudes than before sedation and hypersynchronous activity wasunmasked again. No spontaneous breathing was found and after stimulation thepatient opened his eyes without any ﬁxation or spontaneous movements.\\nParticularly synchronous mass movements and exhaustible cloni were obvious andthe patient showed a severe muscular hypotonia. Brain MRI revealed a progressive\\ncystic degradation of the cortex and peripheral white matter with nearly complete\\ndestruction of the cerebrum. The patients died at the age of 10 weeks.\\nThe patient had PL resistant seizure and obvious brain damage. These ﬁndings\\nindicate that the MRI damage pattern of this patient seemed to be due to a hypoxic –\\nischemic event occurring in conjunction with seizures and was possibly aggravatedby the underlying metabolic disease. Considering that there is no clear hypoxic –\\nischemic episode in this patient ’s history, the TNAP de ﬁciency is considered to be\\nat least partially involved in this damage pattern leading to neuronal cell death via\\nimbalances or disturbances in phosphate, vitamin B6 or adenosine triphosphate\\n(ATP) metabolism. No similar images have been reported in patients withHPP. TNAP is present in the synapses of the cerebral cortex (Fonta et al. 2004 ) that\\nare involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, synaptic stabilization, and myelin pat-tern formation (Fonta et al. 2004 ,2005 ;Négyessy et al. 2011 ; Hanics et al. 2012 ).\\nA study in TNAP-KO mice also showed that lack of TNAP compromises myeli-nation and synaptogenesis in the cerebral cortex (Hanics et al. 2012 ). The Brain\\nBlood Barrier (BBB) is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells (with other cells)\\nwhich are alkaline phosphatase positive in many animals but lose their marker\\nenzyme in culture (Deracinois et al. 2012 ) (see Chap. 7). TNAP function in human\\nendothelial cells is not clearly identi ﬁed. TNAP, however, is known to be involved-ketoglutarate\\nSuccinateTCAcycle\\nSuccinic semialdehydeGlutamate\\nGABAGAD PLP \\nGABA-T PLP α\\nFig. 14.3 GABA and glutamate metabolic pathway, GABA gamma-aminobutyric acid, GAD\\nglutamic acid decarboxylase, GABA-T GABA transaminase, PLP pyridoxal 5 ′phosphate, TCA\\ntricarboxylic acid314 T. Taketaniin the transport of pyridoxine across the BBB subsequently used in neurotransmitter\\nmetabolism (Hofmann et al. 2013 ). TNAP is expressed during early stages of brain\\nvessel development coincident with the appearance of functional BBB. In addition,TNAP seems to be involved in purinergic signaling by producing adenosine\\nthrough dephosphorylation of ATP. TNAP is localized in growth cones next to\\nATP-receptors (P2X7) and it seems to be essential for axonal growth of hippo-campal neurons by regulating both ligand availability and protein expression ofP2X7 receptor (D íez-Zaera et al. 2011 ). These data suggest that TNAP may play a\\nrole in central nervous system (CNS) development and activity-dependent corticalfunctions (see Chaps. 4,5and18).\\n14.4 Intracranial Hypertension\\nThe premature closure of sutures is held responsible for intracranial hypertension in\\npatients with HPP (Whyte 2001 ,2010 ; Mornet 2008 ). Craniosynostosis is a\\nwell-known feature of the infantile and childhood HPP (Whyte 2001 ,2010 ; Mornet\\n2008 ) while it misses in the adult and odonto-HPP types, thereby suggesting a\\ndirect relationship with the degree of enzymatic de ﬁciency (Collmann et al. 2009 ).\\nCollmann et al. ( 2009 ) reported a series of 7 children among 20 cases of infantile\\nand childhood HPP who had craniosynostosis and discussed the functional prob-lems arising from HPP. However, biochemical analysis in these 7 cases did notreveal any overt differences from the 13 other childhood HPP individuals notaffected by craniosynostosis. No particular genetic mutational pattern was found inthe synostotic individuals. In addition, the age range and the distribution of sub-types did not differ between these two subgroups. Intracranial hypertensiondeveloped after the age of 1 year. Neurosurgical intervention was necessary in 4\\ncases. Secondary ectopia of the cerebellar tonsils were detected in ﬁve of the 7\\npatients and caused hydrosyringomyelia in one of them.\\nSkull pathology in HPP has been reported as hypomineralization, which, in the\\nmost severe perinatal form, results in a “caput membranaceum ”. In the less severe\\ninfantile form, widely diastatic sutures or at least multiple Wormian bones havebeen reported (Macpherson et al. 1972 ; Kaplan et al. 1991 ). They seem to precede\\nsutural obliteration and should, therefore, be considered as functionally closedsutures (Collmann et al. 2009 ). In fact, MacPherson et al. ( 1972 ) found uncalci ﬁed\\nosteoid as substrate mimicking this sutural gap. According to Collmann et al.\\n(2009 ), premature fusion in HPP appears to start with the sagittal or coronal suture.\\nHowever, synostosis may progressively involve all main cranial sutures duringchildhood. In these cases, intracranial hypertension putting the optic nerve at riskshould be anticipated. Of importance, the lambdoid suture tends to close early,thereby possibly preventing normal expansion of the posterior fossa. This mayexplain the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils as a secondary phenomenon. Of note,none of patients with intracranial hypertension developed epileptic seizures\\n(Collmann et al. 2009 ).14 Neurological Symptoms of Hypophosphatasia 315Since cranial sutures are frequently involved in infantile and childhood HPP, a\\nmultidisciplinary approach for the clinical care is necessary, including long-termneurosurgical surveillance (Collmann et al. 2009 ). It often progressively involves\\nall cranial sutures and poses signi ﬁcant functional risks to the optic nerves, as well\\nas the spinal cord. The evaluation of HPP in childhood should include plain\\nradiographs and, in case of premature sutural fusion, MR imaging and repeatedophthalmoscopic assessment (Collmann et al. 2009 ). With regard to the progressive\\nnature of craniosynostosis, careful surveillance is recommended throughout child-hood until adolescence and, in the presence of Chiari I malformation or hydrosy-ringomyelia, probably throughout life (Collmann et al. 2009 ).\\n14.5 Neurological Symptoms of Japanese HPP Patients\\nThere are very few group- or country-speci ﬁc reports on the clinical and genetic\\nfeatures of HPP in pediatric patients. However, the common ALPL mutations\\nobserved in Japanese patients, i.e., homozygous mutation of c.1559delT andcompound heterozygous mutation of c.T979C (p.F327L) have been shown to beassociated with relatively lethal and mild types of HPP, respectively (Michigami\\net al. 2005 ; Ozono and Michigami 2011 ; Watanabe et al. 2011 ). Therefore, we\\nretrospectively examined the clinical and genetic aspects of HPP in total 56Japanese children including 52 reported by Taketani et al. ( 2014 ) Mutations of the\\nALPL gene were analyzed in 35 patients. The frequencies of patients with perinatal\\nlethal, prenatal benign, infantile, childhood, and odonto type HPP were 23, 16, 5, 9,and 3, respectively. There was neither adult type nor mild HPP with AD inheri-tance. Clinical characteristics by genotype are show in Table 14.1.\\nAbout neurological symptoms, seizure was found in 14 patients (11 perinatal\\nlethal, 1 infantile and 2 childhood types). Seizure in perinatal lethal and infantile\\ntypes was PRS. They occurred in patients within 1 month after birth. Two casesdeveloped seizure before detection of bone symptoms. Computed Tomography andMRI image did not have abnormal ﬁndings. Eight patients of them died within the\\nage of 5 years. Two patients with seizure in childhood type were diagnosed asfebrile convulsion and epilepsy in each. These two cases did not exhibit seizure inneonatal period. Encephalopathy was found in two patients with perinatal lethaltype. Seizure and disturbance of consciousness occurred in both without hypoxic\\nand ischemic episodes. Brain MRI revealed diffuse cerebral edema. All patients had\\nsevere sequelae including mental and developmental retardation, incapacitate statusand respiratory failure with arti ﬁcial ventilation. Mental retardation was detected in\\n11 patients (5 perinatal lethal, 2 prenatal benign, 1 infantile and 3 childhood types).Assessment of mental retardation was performed by: developmental quotientscores, the Enjoji scale of infant analytical development, or intelligence quotient.Four patients among 11 patients with mental retardation (3 perinatal lethal and 1infantile types) had hypoxic events, the 7 others did not. This suggested that the\\nTNAP de ﬁciency might be partially involved in mental retardation. Deafness316 T. Taketanideveloped in 5 perinatal lethal patients. The auditory tests were normal at birth,\\nsuggesting that deafness was acquired after birth and was not congenital. The kindof hearing loss was both conductive and sensorineural pattern by the auditory tests.The degree of deafness varies and two patients with severe deafness needed to wear\\na hearing device. It is possible that the acquisition of deafness may be exacerbated\\nby hypomineralization of the ear ossicles.

Short stature was de ﬁned as −2\\nSD of height. The diagnostic criteria of GHD were as follows: (1) height less than\\n−2.5 SD, (2) insulin-like growth factor-1 less than 200 ng/mL, and (3) GH release\\ndeﬁciency in GH secretion test with insulin, arginine, or L-DOPA. GHD in all\\npatients was GH release de ﬁciency in GH secretion test with insulin, arginine, or\\nL-DOPA, demonstrated that GH-secretion by the pituitary gland was decreased.GHD developed in all but perinatal lethal type. Bone symptoms such as shorteningor deformity of the extremities occasionally delayed the diagnosis of GHD.Interestingly, there was one patient who was diagnosed with HPP because of thedifferential diagnosis of short stature, suggesting that we need to consider HPP\\nwhen further examination of short stature is performed.\\nALPL mutations were identi ﬁed in 35 patients: 14 perinatal lethal, 9 prenatal\\nbenign, 5 infantile, 5 childhood, and 2 odonto types (Table 14.2). The remaining 21\\npatients did not receive genetic testing. Two mutant alleles were identi ﬁed in 35\\npatients and no heterozygous mutations were found, suggesting that mostJapanese HPP cases are the result of AR inheritance. Mutations in c.1559delT (34alleles) and p.F327L (12 alleles) were the frequent mutations. The most frequent\\nTable 14.2 Genetic analysis of the ALPL gene in HPP Japanese patients\\nClinical types Genotype Number of patients\\nPerinatal lethal type c.1559delT/c.1559delT 8\\nc.1559delT/p.N190del 1c.1559delT/p.H324R 1c.1559delT/p.G426S 1c.1559delT/p.R450C 1c.1559delT/p.F327del 1p.R223Q/p.R272C 1\\nPrenatal benign type c.1559delT/p.F327L 4\\np.F327L/p.R428X 1p.F327L/p.G456R 1p.F327del/p.R184 W 1p.A40 V/p.E191G 2\\nInfantile type c.1559delT/p.L299P 2\\nc.1559delT/p.F327L 1c.1559delT/p.Y436C 1p.K224E/p.G426C 1\\nChildhood type c.1559delT/pF327L 3\\np.F327L/p.G339R 1p.F327L/p.A111T 1\\nOdonto type c.1559delT/p.R136H 2\\nModi ﬁed from Taketani et al. ( 2014 )318 T. TaketaniJapanese HPP genotype was a homozygous mutation (c.1559delT/c.1559delT) and\\nthe compound heterozygous mutation of c.1559delT/p.F327L which was observedin 8 patients of each. Interestingly, patients with p.F327L were all HPP types exceptfor the perinatal lethal type. In the Japanese population, the prevalence of the\\n1559delT homozygous mutation in the ALPL gene, which is a common mutation\\nthat causes the perinatal lethal form, was estimated to be not less than 1/900,000(Watanabe et al. 2011 ). Michigami et al. ( 2005 ) reported that c.1559delT represent\\n40.9 % of severe alleles. This mutation was not found in other countries, suggestingthat c.1559delT may be a founder mutation in the Japanese population.\\nCompared with previous reports of HPP clinical characteristics in Western\\npopulations (Whyte 2001 ,2010 ; Mornet 2008 ), the frequency of mental retardation,\\ndeafness, and short stature were more frequent in Japanese HPP patients, while\\nseizure and encephalopathy was approximately the same. Difference in the fre-\\nquency and the degree of each neurological feature remains unknown, but thisdifference might depend on the severity of the TNAP activity as well as the dif-ferences in the genetic backgrounds of patients. Especially, about the most frequentmutation, c.1559delT, this mutant lost TNAP activity and was localized at thejuxtanuclear position, but not on the cell surface (Michigami et al. 2005 ; Komaru\\net al. 2005 ). As referred above, TNAP is likely to have a valuable role in CNS\\ndevelopment and functions (Fonta et al. 2004 ,2005 ;Négyessy et al. 2011 ; Hanics\\net al. 2012 ;Díez-Zaera et al. 2011 ). But patients with the same genotype did not\\nnecessarily have the same neurological symptoms. This suggests that cerebralimpairment, including seizure, encephalopathy, mental retardation, deafness, andGHD might be the consequence not only of genetic alterations but also of epige-netic changes, ethnic factors, environmental factors and nutritious element.\\nConﬂict of Interest The author declares no con ﬂict of interest.\\nReferences\\nBalasubramaniam S, Bowling F, Carpenter K, Earl J, Chaitow J, Pitt J, Mornet E, Sillence D,\\nEllaway C (2010) Prenatal hypophosphatasia presenting as neonatal epileptic encephalopathy\\nwith abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism secondary to reduced co-factor pyridoxal-5 ′-\\nphosphate availability.

Estimating prevalence of \\nthe adult form  has been increasingly difficult  due to low rates of diagnosis and variability \\nin clinical manifestations.3 The adult form typically presents during middle age and is \\ncharacterized by bone hypomineralization, debilitating bone pain, recurrent non -healing \\nmetatarsal stress fractures, and poor dentition.2 Lab studies reveal low ALP levels, \\nelevated vitamin B 6 levels and elevated inorganic pyrophosphate.1 Numerous gene \\nmutations related to the disease have been discovered, requiring astute suspicion of this \\ndisease in the appropriate clinical setting.4 Furthermore, each subtype of \\nhypophosphatasia has a variety of manifestations and unique clinical courses, making  the \\ndevelopment of  a successful treatment challenging.  \\n \\nIn October 2015, the Federal Drug Administration approved a bone -targeted recombinant \\nTNS ALP , asfotase alfa,  for use as enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of \\nperinatal and infantile forms of hypophosphatasia.1 The clinical trials for the medication \\nwere based only on the perinatal and infantile  forms of hypophosphatasia, therefore th e \\nDOI:10.4158/ACCR -2019 -0143  \\n© 2019 AACE.  \\n \\n feasibility and efficacy in the other types , including adult -onset, remain unclear at this \\ntime.1 The long -term effects of the medication and resultant elevation of alkaline \\nphosphatase expression are currently unknown.  \\n \\nFew case reports have been publi shed regarding use of asfotase alfa in adults due to the \\nrecent FDA approval  of the drug . Freitas et al published a case report in 2018 describing \\nthe clinical success of using asfotase alfa to treat a 36 -year-old male with initially \\nmisdiagnosed hypophosp hatasia. After 12 months of treatment with asfotase alfa, the \\npatient had improved or stabilized findings on high -resolution peripheral quantitative \\ncomputed tomography and bone mineral density, as well as improved quality of life.4 \\nKlidaras et al publishe d two clinical cases wherein asfotase alfa improved fracture \\nhealing, clinically and radiographically, in adults  with hypophosphatasia.5 \\n \\nWe present a unique case of adult -onset hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa \\nresulting in improvements on whole body scan and daily pedometer step counts after \\ntreatment.   \\n \\nCASE REPORT  \\nIn 2014, a 52 -year-old female with a history of hypertension, c hronic pain and \\nosteoarthritis of hips, knees and spine presented with 10 years of bony pain, poor balance, \\nfalls, fractures and recent dental disease of premature tooth loss. She had history of \\nmultiple low -trauma fragility fractures including ribs, metat arsals, and an ankle fracture. \\nPertinent physical exam findings included tenderness of long bones and waddling gait \\nDOI:10.4158/ACCR -2019 -0143  \\n© 2019 AACE.  \\n \\n with the use of ski poles as assistive walking devices. Blood examination was remarkable \\nfor low ALP at 11 U/L (normal 35 -120 U/L) and low b one-specific ALP of 3 ug/L \\n(normal 7.0 -22.4 ug/L). Without the use of vitamin supplements, Vitamin B 6 level was \\nsignificantly elevated at greater than 2000 nmol/L (normal 20.0 -125.0 nmol/L). Calcium \\nlevel was 9.8 mg/dL (normal 8.5 -10.1 mg/dL) and serum pho sphorus was elevated at 5.2 \\nmg/dL (normal 2.3 -4.6 mg/dL). Intact parathyroid hormone level was elevated at 114.1 \\npg/mL (normal 18.5 -88.0 pg/mL), with known diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, GFR \\n27 mL/min (normal >60 mL/min). Her 24 -hour urine calcium, 2 5-OH vitamin D, serum \\nprotein electrophoresis, celiac screening test and thyroid hormone studies were all \\nnormal. Serum non -fasting N -telopept ide level was elevated at 25.9 nM (normal 6.2 to \\n19.0 nM). SPECT technetium whole body scan demonstrated increased  uptake with \\nmultiple fractures of the axial skeleton and proximal femurs, imaging consistent with \\noncogenic osteomalacia. Due to these imaging findings concerning for oncogenic \\nosteomalacia, further work -up included fibroblast growth factor 23 and  indium 111 \\noctreotide scan both resulting without  evidence of tumor. DEXA scan showed osteopenia \\nof the left hip and right forearm. Thus, the diagnosis of  adult -onset hypophosphatasia was \\nmade.  \\n \\nInitially, due to lack of other treatment options at the time and wi th the hope of lowering \\nbone loss rate to prevent further fractures, she was treated with denosumab. After \\nreceiving just three injections, she developed a new atypical femur fracture requiring \\nsurgical rod placement; subsequently, denosumab was discontinu ed.  \\n \\nDOI:10.4158/ACCR -2019 -0143  \\n© 2019 AACE.  \\n \\n In April 2017, she was started on off -label use of asfotase alfa at a dose of 1 mg/kg three \\ntimes weekly subcutaneously. The off -label use of the medication was justified by the \\npatient’s deterioration and the desire for treatment. Furthermore, some of her symptoms, \\nincluding tooth decay, had begun in childhood, however the majority became pronounced \\nas an adult. Within six months of initiation, the patient noted significant improvements in \\nbalance, endurance, and bone pain. Prior to treatment, the pa tient required an assistive \\ndevice to walk a maximum of 3000 steps per day. After 10 months of treatment with \\nasfotase alfa, she was able to walk 10,000 to 15,000 steps per day counted by her FitBit \\nand play golf. She had a repeat whole body scan in Octobe r 2017 showing less focal \\nuptake overall, consistent with healing fractures. Furthermore, as expected, her ALP level \\nincreased to 3140 U/L (normal 35 -120 U/L) and bone specific ALP increased to 881.7 \\nug/L (normal 7.0 -22.4 ug/L). Unfortunately, the patient’ s lab was not able to perform the \\npyridoxal -5-phosphate level after treatment.  \\n \\nDISCUSSION  \\nHypophosphatasia is a  group of  rare inh erited systemic disease s that cause debilitating \\nmanifestations that appear at varying ages and progress over time. Studies have shown \\nthat there is a high burden of symptoms and poor overall quality of life among adults with \\nhypophosphatasia.3 Unfortunately, due to the low preva lence  of disease  and lack of \\nawareness , hypophosphatasia is often misdiagnosed as other more common \\nrheumat ologic or bone related diseases .  \\n \\nDOI:10.4158/ACCR -2019 -0143  \\n© 2019 AACE.  \\n \\n This case report provides insight into the clinical evaluation of osseous symptoms and \\nhighlights the importance o f a broad differential diagnosis that includes \\nhypophosphatasia. Diagnostic evaluation should be completed with a thorough history \\nand physical exam along with laboratory studies including ALP, vitamin B 6, calcium, \\nphosphorus and PTH levels. In this case r eport, the evaluation for oncogenic \\nosteomalacia was undertaken due to the SPECT technetium whole body scan findings, \\nhowever the scan should have stated that the findings were consistent with osteomalacia; \\nfurther work -up for oncogenic osteomalacia was un necessary in the absence of \\nhypophosphatemia. Increased awareness among providers regarding this unique \\ncondition will improve disease recognition and avoid improper or delayed diagnoses that \\ncould lead to decreased quality of life for patients.  \\n \\nIn an at tempt to improve our patient’s symptoms, she was briefly treated with \\ndensoumab; however antiresorptive medications should not be used to treat \\nhypophosphatasia. The treatment of adult -onset hypophosphatasia with asfotase alfa, as \\npresented in this case re port, resulted in significant improvements in the patient’s \\nsubjective symptoms as well as measurable markers of improvement such as imaging and \\npedometer step counts. Her initial bone scan demonstrated multiple fractures of the axial \\nskeleton and proximal  femurs. After just 6 months of enzyme replacement therapy, her \\nbone scan showed less focal uptake overall, correlating with healing fractures. \\nFurthermore, over the same short time period, the patient  went  from minimal walking \\nwith an assistive device to five times the amount of pedometer recorded steps with out \\nDOI:10.4158/ACCR -2019 -0143  \\n© 2019 AACE.  \\n \\n the use of a  supporting assistive device. This unique case exhibits quantifiable \\nimprovement in quality of life based on the increased pedometer reading data.  \\n \\nThese positive results after treatmen t are promising for future management of this \\ndebilitating disease with use of asfotase alfa. Unfortunately, the long -term risks \\nassociated with asfotase alfa treatment are unclear. Additionally, the elevation of alkaline \\nphosphatase levels after treatment  with asfotase alfa has unknown  long term  clinical \\nsignificance  on bone health .  \\n \\nAs demonstrated in the clinical case above, asfotase  alfa provides significant clinical \\nbenefits to patients diagnosed with adult -onset hypophosphatasia, a rare disease with few \\nclinical studies and treatment options. However it is important to note that this is a \\nsingular case report of one patient’s exper ience with the use of this medication. \\nFurthermore, a limitation of this case report is that the improvement on bone scan \\nimaging could be due to time -dependent effect of fracture healing, regardless of enzyme \\nreplacement therapy. However, this case still highlights important possible future \\nendeavors with this enzyme replacement therapy.  \\n \\nCONCLUSION  \\nWe present a distinctive case of adult -onset hypophosphatasia with clinical proof of \\nimprovement after treatment with asfotase alfa based on an increased daily  step count and \\nimproved findings on whole body scan. Asfotase alfa is a newly approved enzyme \\nreplacement therapy for hypophosphatasia and therefore long -term outcomes are not yet \\nDOI:10.4158/ACCR -2019 -0143  \\n© 2019 AACE.  \\n \\n available. However, short -term patient reported subjective findings and cli nical data are \\nreassuring for benefits of treatment with this medication. Increased awareness of the \\ndisease process will prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments, thereby \\nprevent ing complications such as fractures, loss of teeth, chondrocalcinosi s and arthritis \\nwhile improving the overall quality of life.  \\n \\nDISCLOSURE  \\nThe authors have no multiplicity of interest to disclose.  \\n \\nREFERENCES  \\n1.

HPP is the result of mutations involving the gene for tissue nonspeci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase. Five clinical types\\nof HPP are recognized. The clinical presentation of HPP vari es from devastating prenatal intrauterine disease to mild\\nmanifestations in adulthood. In adults, main clinical invo lvement includes early loss of primary or secondary teeth,\\nosteoporosis, bone pain, chondrocalcino sis, and fractures. Treatment for HPP is li mited. Asfotase alfa is a subcutaneously\\nadministered synthetic human alkaline phosphatase that is approved for treatme nt of patients, including adults, with\\nperinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP. However, guidelines for the treatment of adults with HPP are not available.

Treatment is now available\\nfor HPP in infants and children.\\n(1)However, less has been\\nwritten about the diagnosis and treatment of HPP in adults.In addressing these issues, we offer an overview of what iscurrently known of HPP in adults. Our aim is to promotediscussion and further study of the management of adultswith HPP until the medical evidence and clinical experienceare suf ﬁcient to allow the development of evidence-based\\nclinical practice guidelines.\\nHPP is the result of mutations involving the gene ALPL on\\nchromosome 1, which encodes for tissue nonspeci ﬁc\\nalkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), an ecto-enzyme bound tomembrane inositol-phosphate on the outer surface ofosteoblasts reported in standard laboratory test metabolicpanels as total serum alkaline phosphatase.\\n(2)This enzyme\\ndephosphorylates several substrates, including inorganicpyrophosphate (PPi), an inhibitor of bone mineralizationproduced by osteoblasts and c hondrocytes. The accumula-\\ntion of PPi when TNSALP is de ﬁcient impairs tissue calcium/\\nphosphate formation of hydroxyapatite, leading to theaccumulation of unmineralized osteoid, a feature of ricketsand osteomalacia.Background\\nThere are ﬁve major clinical types of HPP (Table 1). The disorder\\nis more severe and may be lethal when expressed in utero orperinatal in infants. Certain infants with the perinatal phenotypemay follow a more benign course for reasons unexplained.However, when symptoms ﬁrst occur at older ages, as in\\nchildhood or in adults, the expression of the disease, althoughvariable, tends to be less severe. Inherited as either an autosomalrecessive or autosomal dominant trait, HPP is characterized bymarked variability in clinical expression, even within affectedfamilies. There is no de ﬁned treatment for adults with HPP.\\nTeriparatide has been used with variable success.\\n(3)Recombi-\\nnant human alkaline phosphatase (asfotase alfa) was approvedby the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2015for treatment in adults where evidence of the disease waspresent in childhood (Strensiq; Alexion Pharmaceutical, NewHaven, CT, USA).\\n(4)We discuss here the clinical ﬁndings in adults\\nwith HPP that would suggest consideration of treatment withasfotase alfa, understanding that there are no current dataregarding effectiveness or optimal treatment regimen inadult HPP.\\nThe hallmark of HPP is a low age- and sex-adjusted total serum\\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP). ALP levels decrease from high levelsduring childhood to adult levels of 40 U/L to 117 IU/L at the ageof 13 to 14 years in females and 15 to 17 in males.\\n(5)Some drugs\\n(eg, glucocorticoids, ﬁbrates, estrogen) and multiple systemic\\nillnesses (eg, zinc and magnesium de ﬁciency, celiac disease,\\nReceived in original form May 13, 2017; revised form July 14, 2017; accepted July 19, 2017.

However, as emphasized by Maman and colleaguesand as we have con ﬁrmed in our review of patient records, low\\nALP is often not recognized by physicians as a matter of clinicalconcern.\\n(6)\\nThere is great heterogeneity of clinical expression in adults\\nwith HPP. Adults may be essentially asymptomatic, havenonspeci ﬁc symptoms such as joint pain or loss of secondary\\nteeth, and have low bone mineral density (BMD). A history ofchildhood symptoms and early loss of primary teeth mayhave been forgotten. Joint pain and restricted motion arecommon in HPP as a consequence of chondrocalcinosis. HPPmay be associated with deposition of hydroxyapatite crystalsin rotator cuff, elbow, and Achilles tendons. Some patientsare disabled with recurrent poor ly healing fractures. Berkseth\\nand colleagues reported the clinical ﬁndings of 22 adults with\\nHPP diagnosed from 1976 through 2008 at the Mayo Clinic(Rochester, MN, USA).\\n(7)In this cohort, the median minimum\\nserum ALP was 43% below normal limit. Most of the patients(68%) were symptomatic at presentation, and 41% had\\nmusculoskeletal pain. A history of fracture was present in\\n54%, with 36% having multiple fractures. Chondrocalcinosiswas found radiologically in 27%; 14% had pyrophosphate\\narthropathy. Atypical femur fractures have been reported in apatient with HPP who was treated with alendronate,suggesting that HPP may be a risk factor for this rare typeof fracture, especially in the setting of treatment with abisphosphonate.\\n(8)In a retrospective case –control study of\\n10 individuals with atypical femur fractures previouslytreated with bisphosphonates and 13 patients on bi-sphosphonates without such fractures, there was nobiochemical or genetic eviden ce implicating hypophospha-\\ntasia as a risk factor these fractures;\\n(9)none of the patients in\\nthis study had a diagnosis of HPP.\\nThe impact of HPP on patients ’quality of life was examined\\nby Weber and colleagues in a group of 125 patients by meansof advocacy groups and survey questions concerningmedical history, mobility, and health-related quality oflife.\\n(10)Similar to the report of Beckseth and colleagues,(7)\\n95% of patients listed pain as a major complaint, 86% ofpatients had fractures, and 26% reported more than 10fractures; 62% had muscle weakness, and 52% reportedunusual gait. Sixty percent reported use of assistive devicesfor mobility; 74% of patients had undergone orthopedic/dental surgical procedures.\\nDiagnosis of HPP in Adults\\nAdults with HPP may come to clinical attention by ﬁnding low-\\nserum ALP on routine laboratory testing or during the course ofevaluation for osteoporosis or fractures. If low-serum ALP is\\nconﬁrmed on repeat testing and other causes of low ALP are\\neliminated, elevation of serum pyridoxal-5 ’-phosphate (vitamin\\nB6) and/or elevation of urinary of phosphoethanolamine (PEA)support the diagnosis. Only one of these biomarkers may beelevated in some patients with HPP. The ﬁnding of a mutation in\\nthe ALPL gene provides additional level of con ﬁrmation, but is\\nnot a requirement for the clinical diagnosis of HPP.\\nTreatment of HPP in Adults\\nTreatment with teriparatide in an effort to increase osteoblastproduction of ALP has been reported to date in a total of 10adult patients. However, the effects of treatment on BMD havebeen variable. Teriparatide reportedly improved pain, mobility,\\nand fracture repair in two sisters with HPP ages 56 and\\n64 years.\\n(11)Comacho and colleagues treated two women,\\nages 53 and 68 years, with HPP.(12)Serum ALP increased in one\\npatient while receiving teriparatide, but BMD remainedunchanged; no new fractures were sustained. Serum ALPincreased transiently in the second patient. Femoral neck BMDincreased signi ﬁcantly during the ﬁrst cycle, declined signi ﬁ-\\ncantly afterwards, and was regained during a second course ofteriparatide. However, a fracture occurred shortly aftertreatment was discontinued. Teriparatide treatment failed toheal a humerus fracture with pseudoarthrosis in a 43-year-oldwoman with HPP.\\n(13)\\nA recent publication reports the treatment of 8 adult patients\\nwith HPP with a monoclonal anti-sclerostin antibody (BPS804) ina phase IIA escalating-dose trial.\\n(14)Treatment for 29 weeks\\nincreased bone formation markers as well as a transientdecrease in the bone resorption marker C-telopeptide. Lumbarspine BMD showed a mean increase of 3.9% at end of the study.\\nAfter the FDA approval of asfotase alfa, it has been used to\\ntreat infants, children, and some adults with HPP.\\n(15,16)At this\\ntime, there are no guidelines for selecting adult patients fortreatment, for evaluating the results of treatment, or determin-ing the optimal duration of treatment. Because treatment withasfotase alfa is likely to be expanded as more patients arediagnosed, we present suggestions for the evaluation ofpatients with regard to indications for starting treatment andassessment of treatment response. The question of how longtreatment should be continued must await the evaluation ofclinical trials.\\nCare should be taken to avoid some medications commonly\\nused in the treatment of osteoporosis that might be harmful inpatients with HPP. Treatment with bisphosphonates and possiblydenosumab may have adverse effects in adults with HPP. Anypotent antiresorptive agent might lower serum ALP, which is\\nalready low in patients with HPP. Excessive vitamin D intake may\\naggravate the occurrence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.\\nConsiderations Related to the Treatment of\\nAdults with HPP\\nThe recent interest in treating adults with HPP occurs at a time\\nwhen the clinical indications for initiating treatment are notdeﬁned, in part because this is a rare disorder with which most\\nphysicians have no or limited experience. Because there is apaucity of data and little guidance from the FDA for identifyingadult HPP patients for treatment with asfotase alfa, we suggestthat one or more of the following criteria, when felt to beTable 1. Clinical Types of Hypophosphatasia\\nPerinatal In utero and at birth\\nInfantile <6 months\\nChildhood/juvenile >6 months to >18\\nyears\\nAdult >18 years\\nOdontohypophosphatasia (dental\\nonly)Any age\\n1978 SHAPIRO AND LEWIECKI Journal of Bone and Mineral Researchsecondary to HPP, be present before treatment is considered.\\nAlthough these are suggested as pote n t i a lc l i n i c a li n d i c a t i o n sf o r\\ntreatment, we suggest that the extent of disability should also be amajor factor guiding the decision to treat. The fundamentalprinciples for treating adults with HPP are that the goals oftreatment should be identi ﬁed before starting treatment and that\\nobjective baseline and follow-up assessments are made to monitorfor treatment effect and attainment of the treatment goals. Thepatient may assist in setting ind ividualized treatment goals.\\nWe suggest that treatment of adults with HPP be considered\\nwhen there is a history of childhood involvement (before age 18years), such as early loss of primary or secondary teeth,craniosynostosis, gait disturbance, developmental delays, skele-tal deformity, bone pain or fractures, or when there is nodocumentation of childhood symptoms, and one or more of thefollowing is present, determined to be clinically signi ﬁcant and\\nattributable to HPP:\\n1. Musculoskeletal pain requiring prescription pain medica-\\ntions, especially chronic opioids\\n2. Disabling polyarthropathy or chondrocalcinosis3. Major low-trauma fracture (eg, spine, hip, humerus, pelvis)\\nattributable to HPP\\n4. Delayed or incomplete fracture healing or fracture non-\\nunion\\n5. Repeated episodes of orthopedic surgery for complications\\nof HPP, especially for non-union and delayed unionfractures\\n6. Disabling functional impairment (eg, mobility, gait, activi-\\nties of daily living) assessed by validated measures\\n7. Low BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA):\\nT-score/C20–2.5 in postmenopausal women and men age\\n50 years and older, or Z-score/C20–2.0 in younger adult\\nwomen and men in patients with fractures\\n8. Radiological evidence of nephrocalcinosis </NL>\\nSome of these clinical manifestations of HPP have a more\\nrobust association with disea se severity than others and any\\nof them may be present and not attributable to HPP.Treatment decisions should be individualized according to allavailable clinical information, including patient preference.\\nThe list is not intended to be all-inclusive. Assessment of\\noutcomes for patients selected for treatment according tothese criteria or others requires validation in clinical trials.The optimal dose of asfotase alfa, dose adjustments, durationof therapy, and possible cycling of dosing in adults with HPPare unknown. Adverse effects of long-term therapy have notbeen de ﬁned.\\nSafety Assessments\\nThe most common adverse reactions ( /C2110%) are injection\\nsite reactions, lipodystrophy, ectopic calci ﬁcations, and\\nhypersensitivity reactions. Li podystrophy, including lipoa-\\ntrophy and lipohypertrophy , may occur, with localized\\nreactions during several mo nths of treatment. Ectopic\\ncalci ﬁcations of the eyes and kidneys can be assessed\\nwith baseline and follow-up ophthalmologic examinationsand renal ultrasounds. Serum ALP measurements ontreatment may be greatly elevated but do not appear to\\nhave harmful effects.Considerations for Efficacy and Safety Assessments\\nat Baseline and 6- to 12-Month Intervals (According\\nto Clinical Circumstances)\\n1. Musculoskeletal-focused physical exam, including bone\\ntenderness, gait speed, mobility, and joint range of motion\\n2. Imaging for joint chondrocalcinosis3.

The decision to continue treatment should be reassessed at\\n6- to 12-month intervals with appropriate consideration ofthe balance of bene ﬁts and risks, achievement of treatment\\ngoals, or likelihood of achieving the goals.\\nSummary\\nThese suggestions are intended to provide informationrelative to the management of adults with HPP. Unlikedata available after treatment of children with severe HPP,the bene ﬁts and risks of treatment in adults remain to be\\ndetermined. Given the high cost of treatment and un-certainties of the treatment effects in adults with HPP, theu s eo fa s f o t a s ea l f as h o u l db er e s e r v e df o rs e v e r e l ya f f e c t e dpatients with well-documented disease. To facilitate thecollection of data, we recommend that physicians treatingadults with HPP enroll them in the HypophosphatasiaRegistry sponsored by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (HPPRegis-\\ntry.com). We also highly recomme nd clinical investigation of\\nadult treatment indications, outcomes of treatment, andstrategies to monitor treatment effect. The suggestions inthis report are preliminary and may serve as an aid tophysicians treating this potentially devastating diseaseuntil evidence-based clinical practice guidelines can bedeveloped.\\nDisclosures\\nJRS and EML are paid for participating in the AlexionPharmaceutical speaker ’s bureau.

Bones are soft and fracture easily and heal slowly. Signs and \\nsymptoms vary greatly among affected individuals, ranging from very mild to severe \\nand life-threatening. The disease is life-long. \\n \\nCause of HPP \\nGene mutation resulting in the inability to manufacture alkaline phosphatase (ALP), \\nan enzyme needed for proper bone mineralization.  \\n \\nGene Defect in HPP \\nMutations in the ALPL gene result in faulty coding for tissue non-specific alkaline \\nphosphatase (TNSALP). Sometimes the gene is called the TNSALP gene. The \\ndefective gene can be inherited as dominant or recessive, depending on the form of \\nHPP.1 The U.S incidence of the gene mutation is 1/200 people.2 \\n \\nIncidence and Prevalence of HPP \\nIncidence of severe HPP is estimated at 1 per 100,000 live births. Incidence of less \\nsevere forms is thought to be greater. Population prevalence of HPP is unknown—\\nmild manifestations can be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.1 \\n \\nHallmarks of HPP \\nSoft, fragile bones that are prone to fracture and heal slowly \\nBowed legs and other skeletal deformities \\nPremature loss of primary teeth \\n \\nOther Potential Clinical Features of HPP \\nPulmonary insufficiency/respiratory difficulty \\nShort stature \\nBone pain \\nPoor muscle tone \\nLoss of adult teeth \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n141 Hawkins Place, #267 \\nBoonton, New Jersey 07005 \\nwww.SoftBones.org \\n \\n3 \\n \\nSeverity of HPP \\nVaries in severity. Mild HPP can manifest as only dental abnormalities. Severe HPP \\ncan be life-threatening. The more severe forms are detected earlier in life. Perinatal \\nHPP detected via ultrasound view of short limbs, abnormal chest shape, soft skull \\nbones. Those most severely affected will fail to form a mineralized skeleton and will \\nhave a life span of days. \\n \\nVariants of HPP \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Perinatal HPP \\nThe most severe form, perinatal HPP is visible prenatally via fetal ultrasound. \\nNewborns have short limbs, abnormal chest shape, and soft skull bones. Life \\nexpectancy is days or weeks. Those most severely affected fail to form a \\nmineralized skeleton in utero and are stillborn. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Infantile HPP  \\nSigns and symptoms become apparent within the first six months. First sign \\nmay be failure to thrive. Skull bones may fuse prematurely, resulting in the \\nappearance of a wide head. Rickets and deformities of the chest and ribs can \\noccur. Hyperkalemia can cause vomiting, constipation, weakness, diminished \\nmuscle tone, and poor feeding. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Childhood HPP  \\nLess severe than the infantile form, but often causes delayed development \\nand delayed attainment of such milestones as sitting, crawling, or walking. \\nPrimary (baby) teeth fall out earlier than expected (before the age of five); \\nchildren may have bowed legs and a misshapen skull, wrists, or ankles. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Adult HPP   \\nTypically diagnosed in middle age; can be mistaken for osteoporosis. Affected \\nadults may have had rickets as children, lost baby teeth early, and may be of \\nshort stature with bowed or deformed legs.  Other features may include \\nwaddling gait, pain, and fatigue. The risk of recurrent fractures, particularly \\nin the feet, increases as adult bones soften. Many affected individuals lead a \\nfull life. Adult HPP is not considered life-threatening. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Odontohypophosphatasia  \\nMildest form of HPP.

The remaining cases result from mutations of other genes, which \\ncan have either dominant or recessive inheritance.4  \\n \\nIncidence and Prevalence of OI5 \\nIncidence is estimated at 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 live births, depending on the \\ntype of OI. The prevalence in the U.S. population is estimated at 20,000 to 50,000 \\nindividuals. OI occurs equally in males and females and occurs in all racial groups.  \\n \\nHallmarks of OI \\nFrequent broken bones from infancy through puberty \\nFracture frequency drops off in early adulthood, then increases in later adulthood \\nBone deformity \\nShort stature \\n \\nOther Potential Clinical Features of OI \\nAppearance and severity vary widely; features may vary with age and can vary \\nwidely among sub-types, within sub-types, and within the same family, but some of \\nthe most widely seen features are: \\nLoose joints (joint laxity) \\nMuscle weakness \\nEarly hearing loss  \\nBluish tint in whites of the eyes \\nLoose teeth that fall out prematurely \\nRespiratory problems resulting from bone deformities \\n   \\n141 Hawkins Place, #267 \\nBoonton, New Jersey 07005 \\nwww.SoftBones.org \\n \\n6 \\n \\nSeverity of OI \\nClassified as mild, moderate, or severe.  Individuals with the most severe forms have \\na shortened life span. With good medical management and supportive care, the \\nmajority of people with OI lead healthy, productive lives with an average life span. \\n \\nVariants of OI \\nFifteen subtypes have been identified. Ascertaining the subtype is important for \\ntreatment decisions and care needs, but the types are not always clear-cut.  An \\nindividual may not show every feature within one subtype or may exhibit features \\nof multiple subtypes. Denoted by Roman numerals, subtypes vary in prevalence and \\nseverity. The most prevalent are Type I through Type VI.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Type I OI  is the most prevalent and the mildest. Affected individuals may \\nshow no outward signs, have minimal or no bone deformity, and reach \\nexpected height. Lifetime fractures are limited, and life expectancy does not \\nappear to be affected. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Type II OI  is the most severe. Babies are born with multiple fractures, an \\nunusually soft skull, and an unstable neck. Because of respiratory problems, \\nnearly all die at birth or shortly afterward \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Type III OI varies in its presentation and severity. Babies are born with \\nfractures; lifetime fractures could total in the hundreds. Other manifestations \\ninclude short stature, curved spine, bone deformities, and a barrel-shaped rib \\ncage. Life span may be shortened due to respiratory problems.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Type IV OI  is considered moderate, with clinical features varying from \\nalmost as mild as Type I to nearing the severity of Type III. It’s characterized \\nby short stature, frequent fractures that typically level off after puberty, and \\nsome bone deformity. Life expectancy is usually normal. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Type V OI  is similar to Type IV, except with the addition of a few distinct \\nfeatures like hypertrophic calluses at fracture sites and limited range of \\nmotion of the forearm. It’s considered a moderate form of the disease. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Type VI is extremely rare. Similar to Type IV, with the addition of a \\ndistinguishing bone-mineralization defect that is discovered via bone biopsy. \\n \\nDiagnosis of OI  \\nClinical observation \\nMedical history \\nGenetic testing \\nBone x-rays  \\n141 Hawkins Place, #267 \\nBoonton, New Jersey 07005 \\nwww.SoftBones.org \\n \\n7 \\n \\nDXA \\nPrenatal ultrasound for severe forms \\nRule out HPP \\n \\nTreatment of OI \\nOI is incurable.  Disease management is focused on minimizing fractures to improve \\nquality of life.  Treatment plans are individualized based on the severity of the \\ndisease and may include surgery, physical therapy, and/or medication.

Vitamin-D metabolism in the kidneys can \\nalso be affected, further exacerbating bone weakness.  \\n \\nCause of Familial Hypophosphatemia \\nA gene defect that interferes with the kidneys’ ability to conserve phosphate and \\nactivate vitamin-D production. The resulting low levels of phosphate and vitamin-D \\nimpair bone mineralization, thus leaving the affected individual with soft, weak \\nbones. \\n \\nGene Defect in Familial Hypophophatemia \\nMutations of the PHEX gene, located on the X chromosome, are responsible for most \\ncases. PHEX mutations increase the levels of a phosphate-regulating hormone that \\ntriggers the kidneys to 1) over-excrete phosphate in the urine, and 2) inhibit \\nactivation of vitamin-D. The resulting condition is known as X-linked \\nhypophosphatemia (XLH). PHEX is a dominant gene; thus XLH can occur in both \\nmales and females. \\n \\nLess commonly, familial hypophosphatemia is inherited through an autosomal \\ndominant mutation, with the ensuing condition referred to as autosomal dominant \\nfamilial hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR). Another variant is inherited as an \\nautosomal recessive trait (ARHR). \\n \\nIncidence and Prevalence of Familial Hypophosphatemia \\nThe incidence of XLH is estimated at 1 in 20,000 individuals.

Molecular bases of HPP are various muta-\\ntions in the ALPL gene (1p36.12, NCBI Gene-ID:249) which is coding\\nfor the ectoenzyme tissue-nonspeci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase [1].\\nThe predominant phenotype of this hereditary disease in its severe\\nearly onset manifestation is characterized by impaired bone minerali-\\nzation and by disorganized growth plates with consecutive\\nmalformations [1]. Moreover, lung hypoplasia and functional impair-\\nment of the CNS , including epileptic seizures, may contribute toearly death within weeks after birth [2].

Another key player in this system\\nis the phosphatase PHOSPHO1 which supports the initiation of hy-droxyapatite deposition in matrix vesicles whereas TNAP enables prop-\\nagation of the newly formed crystals outside the vesicles [6,7] .A sa\\nconsequence, combined ablation of PHOSPHO1 and TNAP completelyprevents skeletal mineralization [7]. In addition, adenosine triphos-\\nphate (ATP), diphosphate (ADP) and monophosphate (AMP) are fur-ther substrates for TNAP [8,9] thus contributing to changes in the\\nmicroenvironmental concentrations of purine-derived compoundsthat orchestrate purinergic signaling via a series of receptors and\\nligand-modulated channels as well as adenosine receptors.

Moreover, expression of\\ntissue-nonspeci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase changes in accordance with\\nthe developmental stage of the brain [11]. In the human neocortex\\nTNAP expression can be found in layer 5 throughout the frontal-,\\ntemporal- and occipital lobes [12]. Further, alkaline phosphatase activi-\\nty is localized in the neuropile alongside the thalamo-cortical innerva-tions in layer 4 of primary visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices\\nand furthermore varies depending on sensory experience. Subcellular\\nlocalization of TNAP enzyme is characterized by accumulation at synap-\\ntic junctions during maturation, its distribution matches GAD\\n65localiza-\\ntion at presynaptic terminals and apart from that alkaline phosphataseis distributed alongside the axon solely in myelin-free parts [13,14] .\\nConsistent with those results Hanics et al. published that TNAP knock-\\nout mice ( Akp2\\n−/−) display severe dysfunctions as far as central pro-\\ncesses like myelination and maturation of synapses are concerned[15]. Moreover, TNAP enzyme might in ﬂuence migration of primordial\\ngerm cells (PGCs) and neurons due to its ability of interaction withextracellular matrix proteins like collagen and further regulates prolif-\\neration and differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons or oligo-\\ndendrocytes [16,17] . Experiments with murine neurons isolated\\nfrom hippocampus samples revealed a connection between TNAP andaxonal growth. TNAP staining shows prominent signals in somatic and\\naxonal regions.

In contrast, no effects of TNAP\\ninhibition could be seen on dendritic outgrowth [18]. Moreover, TNAP\\nmight in ﬂuence neurogenesis during mouse brain development and\\nexpression was found in the subventricular zone in adult mouse\\nbrains, which is one of the few regions where adult neurogenesis\\ntakes place [19].
